  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tetanus-diphtheria vaccine administered to pregnant women may cause pain during and after&#xD;
      administration. Due to the pain that may occur, the compliance of pregnant women towards the&#xD;
      vaccine may be impaired. Therefore, there is a need for methods that are safe for pregnant&#xD;
      women to reduce pain. One of the applications used to reduce pain during intramuscular&#xD;
      injection is local mechanical vibration application. With the application of vibration, the&#xD;
      tactile receptors are stimulated and the pain is localized in a more limited area. One of the&#xD;
      methods used to reduce the pain felt during intramuscular injection is the application of&#xD;
      shotblocker applied to the injection site. The protrusions on the Shotbloker temporarily&#xD;
      suppress the pain thanks to the pressure it exerts on the skin. Thus, the gates to the&#xD;
      central nervous system are closed and pain is reduced. Mechanical vibration and shotblocker&#xD;
      procedures applied before injection are non-invasive. Being simple and safe, it is one of the&#xD;
      appropriate methods that can be preferred by pregnant women to reduce injection pain.&#xD;
      Therefore, in our study, it is aimed to examine the effect of local mechanical vibration and&#xD;
      shotblocker application on pain and patient satisfaction before tetenosis-diphtheria vaccine&#xD;
      in pregnant women.&#xD;

      Pregnant women who meet the inclusion criteria of the study, who request tetanus-diphtheria&#xD;
      (0.5 ml) by their family physician, and who agree to participate in the study will be&#xD;
      informed about the study and their written and verbal consents will be obtained. Then the&#xD;
      vaccine will be administered. Tetanus-diphtheria vaccine will be administered to all pregnant&#xD;
      women in the study by IM in the deltoid muscle in the arm they do not use dominantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools Individual Introduction Form It was prepared by the researchers by&#xD;
      scanning the literature . In the introductory form, there are questions about the age,&#xD;
      education level, marital status, occupation, income status, smoking status, gestational week,&#xD;
      tetonosis vaccination status, height-weight of the pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS) VAS patients are initially painless and eventually represent the&#xD;
      most severe pain they can feel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a 100 mm straight horizontal line with numbers 0 to 10. '0' means no pain, '10' means&#xD;
      severe pain. Participants are asked to mark any number between &quot;0&quot; and &quot;10&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Patient Satisfaction Scale Visual patient satisfaction scale (visual analogue patient&#xD;
      satisfaction scale) overlaps with the features of VAS. It indicates the degree of&#xD;
      satisfaction out of 10. On one side of the scale, &quot;0&quot; (Not at all satisfied) and on the other&#xD;
      side &quot;10&quot; (Very satisfied).&#xD;

'0' means no pain, '10' means severe pain. Participants are asked to mark any number between &quot;0&quot; and &quot;10&quot;.</description>

    <description>Before the injection, local mechanical vibration will be applied for 3 minutes with a vibration device to the deltoid muscle where the injection will be made, and then the vaccine will be given. The vibration device to be used is suitable for contact with the skin and provides 6000 rotations per minute with vibration.&#xD;
Pregnant women who were asked to receive tetanus+diphtheria vaccine by their physician and agreed to participate in the study will be informed about the research by the researcher, and their written and verbal consents will be obtained. Then the vaccine will be administered. Td vaccine will be administered to all pregnant women in the study as IM to the deltoid muscle in the arm they do not use dominantly. Five minutes after the vaccination, the individual descriptor form will be applied to all pregnant women, and the pregnant women will score their satisfaction levels with regard to pain and the method used.</description>
