  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of romosozumab on bone cells during early&#xD;
      and late phases of treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will perform paired iliac crest bone biopsies in postmenopausal women who meet standard&#xD;
      romosozumab treatment indications and are being prescribed romosozumab by their treating&#xD;
      physician. All study volunteers will have a bone biopsy procedure prior to starting therapy,&#xD;
      and then an identical procedure at the contralateral side either 3-6 weeks (&quot;early&quot;) or 6-8&#xD;
      months (&quot;late&quot;) after starting therapy. This is not a randomized clinical trial testing the&#xD;
      efficacy of a drug - we will not be assigning volunteers to a specific osteoporosis therapy,&#xD;
      though we will randomize volunteers to either the early or late second biopsy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All postmenopausal women who are prescribed romosozumab by their treating physicians, meet&#xD;
        the FDA-defined indication for romosozumab, and who are not at increased risk for a bone&#xD;
        marrow aspirate or bone biopsy will be offered enrollment. The FDA approved indication for&#xD;
        romosozumab is: &quot;the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for&#xD;
        fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for&#xD;
        fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis&#xD;
        therapy.&quot; Volunteers must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female aged &gt; 45 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Postmenopausal by either of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. &gt; 36 since last spontaneous menses&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. &gt; 36 months since hysterectomy, plus serum FSH &gt; 40 units / liter if &lt; 60 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  renal disease (stage 4 CKD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  elevated blood PTH (intact PTH &gt; 77 pg/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  serum 25-OH vitamin D &lt; 20 ng/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  major psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude the&#xD;
             subject from providing adequate informed consent or completing the protocol&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  excessive alcohol use or substance abuse that would preclude the subject from&#xD;
             providing adequate informed consent or completing the protocol procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  known congenital or acquired bone disease other than osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  exposure to oral bisphosphonates within the past 3 months, denosumab in the last 12&#xD;
             months, intravenous bisphosphonates within the past 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  exposure to estrogens, SERMs, or calcitonin, oral or parenteral glucocorticoids for&#xD;
             more than 14 days in the past 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  any prior exposure to romosozumab.&#xD;
