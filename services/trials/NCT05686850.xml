  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In intensive care units (ICUs), around 20% of patients experience respiratory failure after&#xD;
      planned extubation. Nearly 40-50% of them eventually require reintubation with subsequently&#xD;
      high mortality rates reaching 30-40%. NIV used as rescue therapy to treat post-extubation&#xD;
      respiratory failure could increase the risk of death. However, NIV may avoid reintubation in&#xD;
      a number of cases, and recent large-scale clinical trials on extubation have shown that&#xD;
      around 40 to 50% of patients with post-extubation respiratory failure are actually treated&#xD;
      with NIV. Whereas high-flow nasal oxygen has never been specifically studied for management&#xD;
      of post-extubation respiratory failure, this respiratory support could also in this setting&#xD;
      constitute an alternative to standard oxygen or NIV. Given the best noninvasive respiratory&#xD;
      support strategy in patients with post-extubation respiratory failure remains unknown, we&#xD;
      have decided to assess whether NIV alternating with high-flow nasal oxygen as compared to&#xD;
      high-flow nasal oxygen alone may decrease mortality of patients in ICUs with post-extubation&#xD;
      respiratory failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In intensive care units (ICUs), around 20% of patients experience respiratory failure after&#xD;
      planned extubation (defined as removal of endotracheal tube after weaning from the&#xD;
      ventilator). Nearly 40-50% of them eventually require reintubation with subsequently high&#xD;
      mortality rates reaching 30-40%.Consequently, a noninvasive respiratory support strategy&#xD;
      aiming at avoiding reintubation deserves consideration. Whereas prophylactic use of&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation (NIV) applied immediately after extubation may prevent respiratory&#xD;
      failure, NIV used as rescue therapy to treat established post-extubation respiratory failure&#xD;
      could increase the risk of death. The largest clinical trial conducted to date by Esteban and&#xD;
      colleagues showed greater mortality with NIV than with standard oxygen. The only factor&#xD;
      explaining the deleterious effects of NIV was that the time before reintubation was markedly&#xD;
      longer than with standard oxygen, suggesting that NIV may worsen the outcome by delaying&#xD;
      reintubation. No further large-scale clinical trial has been performed after this study and&#xD;
      thereby, the most recent international clinical practice guidelines suggest that NIV should&#xD;
      not be used in this setting. However, recent large-scale clinical trials on extubation have&#xD;
      shown that around 40 to 50% of patients with post-extubation respiratory failure are actually&#xD;
      treated with NIV. Indeed, NIV as rescue therapy may avoid reintubation in a number of cases,&#xD;
      especially in patients with underlying chronic lung disease. In a recent post-hoc analysis&#xD;
      focusing on 146 patients with established post-extubation respiratory failure, we found that&#xD;
      mortality was 18% with NIV and 29% with high flow nasal oxygen alone (difference, - 11% [95%&#xD;
      CI, -25% to 2%]; p=0.12). Mortality rates were even significantly lower with NIV than with&#xD;
      high-flow nasal oxygen alone in patients with hypercapnia, suggesting that after all, NIV&#xD;
      might not increase the risk of death. To explain the discrepancies with the Esteban study,&#xD;
      the time interval between NIV initiation and reintubation was markedly shorter in our study&#xD;
      (5 hours in median vs. 12) and predefined criteria for reintubation were established in order&#xD;
      to minimize the risk of delayed intubation. Moreover, all participating centers had extensive&#xD;
      experience in NIV which was not the case in the previous trial. Whereas high-flow nasal&#xD;
      oxygen has never been specifically studied for management of post-extubation respiratory&#xD;
      failure, this respiratory support could in this setting constitute an alternative to standard&#xD;
      oxygen or NIV. High-flow nasal oxygen is increasingly used after extubation in order to&#xD;
      prevent post-extubation respiratory failure, and its beneficial effects have been reported in&#xD;
      treatment of acute respiratory failure. To date, the best noninvasive respiratory support&#xD;
      strategy in patients with post-extubation respiratory failure remains unknown. However,&#xD;
      high-flow nasal oxygen could be included among reference respiratory supports whereas&#xD;
      standard oxygen would be considered as a suboptimal strategy after extubation in&#xD;
      ICUs.Thereby, we have decided to assess whether NIV alternating with high-flow nasal oxygen&#xD;
      as compared to high-flow nasal oxygen alone may decrease mortality of patients in ICUs with&#xD;
      post-extubation respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do that, we propose to conduct a prospective multicenter randomized controlled open-label&#xD;
      trial comparing these 2 strategies of noninvasive respiratory support in patients with&#xD;
      post-extubation respiratory failure in ICUs. Patients included will be randomized as early as&#xD;
      possible after the onset of respiratory failure and will be assigned to one of the 2&#xD;
      following groups, with a 1:1 ratio: high-flow nasal oxygen group treated by high-flow nasal&#xD;
      oxygen alone, or NIV group treated by NIV alternating with high-flow nasal oxygen. As NIV may&#xD;
      be more effective in hypercapnic patients, randomization will be stratified according to the&#xD;
      PaCO2 level measured on blood gas performed at inclusion with the aim at ensuring a balanced&#xD;
      allocation of hypercapnic patients (PaCO2 &gt; 45 mmHg) among the 2 groups.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Duration of invasive mechanical ventilation of more than 24h in the ICU before&#xD;
             extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post-extubation respiratory failure occurring within the first 7 days after extubation&#xD;
             (see criteria below). As in several previous studies, post-extubation respiratory&#xD;
             failure will be defined by the presence of the 2 following criteria combining a&#xD;
             clinical criterion and a blood gas criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinical criterion persisting for at least 30 minutes: a respiratory rate&#xD;
                  exceeding 25 breaths per minute or clinical signs of respiratory distress with&#xD;
                  increased accessory muscle activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Blood gas criterion: Hypoxemia defined as PaO2/FiO2 ratio below 150 mm Hg or&#xD;
                  respiratory acidosis defined as pH below 7.35 units and PaCO2 above 45 mm Hg. For&#xD;
                  patients under standard oxygen, FiO2 will calculated according to the following&#xD;
                  formula: FiO2 = 0.21 + 0.03 x (oxygen flow L/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent from the relatives or the patient himself, or emergency inclusion&#xD;
             procedure in case of inability of patient or proxy to give consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NIV at home&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ICU admission for peripheral neuromuscular disease type Guillain-Barré syndrome or&#xD;
             myasthenia gravis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Upper airway obstruction as main reason for post-extubation respiratory failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urgent need for reintubation (respiratory or cardiac arrest, respiratory pauses with&#xD;
             loss of consciousness or gasping for air, or severe hypoxemia defined as SpO2 lower&#xD;
             than 90% despite maximal oxygen support)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Altered consciousness (Glasgow coma scale &lt; 12)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unplanned extubation (accidental or self-extubation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Do-not-reintubate order at time of respiratory failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient previously included in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  People under protection (minors, persons deprived of liberty by a judicial or&#xD;
             administrative decision, adults under law protection)&#xD;
&#xD;
