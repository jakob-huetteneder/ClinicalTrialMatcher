  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot non-randomized controlled study examined whether the use of VR technology can serve&#xD;
      as an appropriate substitute for sedation in a colonoscopy examination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VR is an attention-distracting technology via visual and auditory signals by a&#xD;
      computer-generated virtual engulfing environment. This technology has already been used in a&#xD;
      variety of medical conditions and previous studies have demonstrated the benefit of using it&#xD;
      as an additional tool for pain relief and as a substitute to sedation in invasive procedure.&#xD;
      In this study we examined the use of VR as a substitute for sedation in colonoscopy. In this&#xD;
      randomized control study, 60 patients were sequentially enrolled in a 1:1 ratio to either&#xD;
      standard sedated colonoscopy or VR-unsedated procedure. The primary outcome was the overall&#xD;
      satisfaction of patients who underwent unsedated colonoscopy with VR headset compared with&#xD;
      patients who underwent standard sedation colonoscopy. Pain during the procedure, PDR,&#xD;
      colonoscopy duration, post colonoscopy adverse events, post colonoscopy recovery and&#xD;
      time-to-return to daily functions and turnaround time at the endoscopy unit were secondary&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
