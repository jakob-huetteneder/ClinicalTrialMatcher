  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Airway protective disorders are a prevalent and progressive consequence of Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease (PD), and often result in aspiration pneumonia which is the leading cause of death in&#xD;
      PD. Despite this, a large number of patients with PD do not access specialized services to&#xD;
      address these critical deficits. The investigators will examine the comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      of a novel treatment paradigm delivered in-person versus via telehealth in persons with PD,&#xD;
      as well as the role of patient burden and treatment adherence on outcomes; thus, the proposed&#xD;
      research is relevant to public health and in line with NIH's mission to identify novel,&#xD;
      efficacious, and accessible rehabilitation strategies for short- and long-term improvement of&#xD;
      dysfunctional airway protection in PD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progressive disorders of airway protection, such as swallowing disorders (dysphagia) and&#xD;
      cough disorders (dystussia), are highly prevalent in PD and have significant negative&#xD;
      implications for health and quality of life. In fact, aspiration pneumonia, commonly&#xD;
      associated with dysphagia/dystussia, is a leading cause of death in PD. Despite this, there&#xD;
      is currently no established standard of care for the treatment of airway protective disorders&#xD;
      in this population. Even more critically, approximately 40% of individuals with PD in the&#xD;
      United States do not access rehabilitation services or receive specialized care for these&#xD;
      potentially life-threatening airway protective deficits. Expiratory Muscle Strength Training&#xD;
      (EMST) and Cough Skill Training (CST) have been found to improve airway protective disorders&#xD;
      in PD and be feasible via telehealth. However, a significant clinical-research gap remains in&#xD;
      that it has not been demonstrated that clinical outcomes are comparable (non-inferior) when&#xD;
      these treatments are delivered via telehealth versus in-person. This gap limits access to&#xD;
      these important services with detrimental effects to health and quality of life. The&#xD;
      long-term goal of this line of research is to improve the health outcomes of individuals with&#xD;
      PD, specifically as they relate to airway protective dysfunction. The objective of this&#xD;
      application is to pair EMST + CST - and compare clinical and patient-centered outcomes when&#xD;
      conducted in-person versus via telehealth in the short- and the long-term. Also, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess the role of specific patient burden factors and resultant treatment&#xD;
      adherence on clinical outcomes. Therefore, the aims of this study are to: 1) Compare clinical&#xD;
      and patient-centered outcomes following four weeks of intensive in-person vs. telehealth&#xD;
      EMST+CST treatment in persons with PD, 2) Compare clinical and patient-centered outcomes from&#xD;
      a long-term EMST+CST maintenance program offered in-person vs. via telehealth in persons with&#xD;
      PD, and 3) Identify the role of specific patient burden factors (i.e., geographic location,&#xD;
      cognitive function, disease severity, and caregiver burden) on treatment adherence in the&#xD;
      short- and long-term and the influence of treatment adherence on clinical outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators will achieve these aims by conducting a two-arm, two site, randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial in 120 people with PD comparing in-person vs. telehealth EMST+CST treatment after a&#xD;
      four-week intensive period (aim1) and after a one year maintenance treatment period (with&#xD;
      assessments at six and 12 months - aim 2). The investigators anticipate our findings will&#xD;
      result in immediately translatable clinical deliverables that will have broad impact for&#xD;
      reduced burden and improved accessibility of treatment. Further, these findings will inform&#xD;
      our future studies investigating these treatments and service delivery models on long-term&#xD;
      outcomes (i.e., aspiration pneumonia, hospitalization, death), accessibility, and healthcare&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;

    <description>Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST). EMST is a widely used and efficacious treatment approach that uses a calibrated device with a one-way, spring-loaded pressure relief valve to mechanically overload the expiratory and submental muscles.&#xD;
Cough Skill Training (CST) involves a digital peak flow meter device which measures PEFR (peak expiratory flow rate) in liters/second and allows patients to receive immediate biofeedback.</description>
