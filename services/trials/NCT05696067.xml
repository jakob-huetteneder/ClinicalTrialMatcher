      The aim of the study is to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of a two-component&#xD;
      intranasal vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 in healthy volunteers 18-60 years old&#xD;
    </textblock>

    <textblock>
      Study include three parts. During the first part the two vaccine components will be&#xD;
      administered separately to a small number of seronegative participants in low dose and then&#xD;
      high dose to evaluate each component's safety. During the second part vaccine components&#xD;
      would be administered one after another with 21 days interval to evaluate safety of the&#xD;
      complete vaccine regimen (low dose and high dose). During the third part of the study the&#xD;
      high dose vaccine will be administered to participants to evaluate vaccine immunogenicity.&#xD;
      The whole study will include 200 participants. Duration of the study for each participant is&#xD;
      about 6.5 months (no more than 194 days).&#xD;
