      In this trial, a single-arm, open-label study design will be used to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability after vaccination with escalating doses of the investigational vaccine&#xD;
      (Recombinant COVID-19 Vaccine (chimpanzee adenovirus vector) for Inhalation, RCVi) at low,&#xD;
      medium, and high doses in healthy adults (previously primed with authorized vaccines).&#xD;
