      This trial aims to assess if, among adults in the ICU with metabolic acidosis, an infusion of&#xD;
      sodium bicarbonate diluted in 5% dextrose, compared with an infusion of 5% dextrose, reduces&#xD;
      Major Adverse Kidney Events within 30 days of randomization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Metabolic acidosis refers to any process that elevates the concentration of&#xD;
      hydrogen ions in the body, and is commonly encountered in critical illness. Lactic acidosis,&#xD;
      diabetic ketoacidosis, and hyperchloremic acidosis are major examples seen in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU). Metabolic acidosis may impair cardiac function, and sodium bicarbonate can&#xD;
      be used to normalise blood pH. Despite being in common clinical usage, the clinical efficacy&#xD;
      of sodium bicarbonate is still uncertain. Previous studies exploring the effects of sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate therapy have been limited and of variable quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This trial aims to assess if, among adults in the ICU with metabolic acidosis, an&#xD;
      infusion of sodium bicarbonate diluted in 5% dextrose, compared with an infusion of 5%&#xD;
      dextrose, reduces Major Adverse Kidney Events within 30 days of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Phase 3, international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Adult patients (≥ 18 years old), admitted to the ICU within 48 hours, receiving&#xD;
      a continuous infusion of a vasopressor drug to maintain a mean arterial pressure &gt; 65 mmHg&#xD;
      (or a mean arterial pressure target set by the treating clinician), a dedicated line (central&#xD;
      or peripheral) is available (or is about to be made available within 1 hour after&#xD;
      randomisation), and within two hours prior to randomisation the participant has metabolic&#xD;
      acidosis, defined as: 1) pH &lt; 7.30; 2) BE ≤ -4 mEq/L; and 3) PaCO2 ≤ 45 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive two treatments&#xD;
      that are commonly used either an infusion of 5% dextrose (D5W) + sodium bicarbonate, or D5W&#xD;
      alone, as a comparator. Study drug will be continuously infused targeting a pH 7.30 - 7.35&#xD;
      and a BE ≥ 0 mEq/L. The infusion will be maintained until this target is achieved and&#xD;
      continued by titration thereafter for a maximum of 5 hours (to maintain target pH and base&#xD;
      excess levels). All other aspects of care will be determined by the treating clinical team,&#xD;
      including the use of additional fluid therapy, vasopressors, and other organ support&#xD;
      modalities. Open-label sodium bicarbonate bolus infusion is allowed in both groups if&#xD;
      clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who meet one or more&#xD;
      criteria for a major adverse kidney event within 30 days (MAKE 30). MAKE 30 is a composite of&#xD;
      death, new receipt of renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as&#xD;
      a final inpatient creatinine value ≥ 200% of the baseline value). All components of MAKE30&#xD;
      will be censored at hospital discharge or 30 days after enrollment, whichever comes first.&#xD;
