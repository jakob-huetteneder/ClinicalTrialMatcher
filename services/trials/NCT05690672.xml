  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two-arm parallel-randomized pilot study and to collect data at the Department of Geriatric&#xD;
      Medicine at Aalborg University Hospital. The aim is to assess the feasibility of a future&#xD;
      randomized controlled study comparing Danish versions of 3D-CAM and 4AT in an acute medical&#xD;
      setting. The primary objective is to assess 1) feasibility of obtaining informed consent and&#xD;
      recruiting older adults within 24 hours of admission (or surgery) at the Department of&#xD;
      Geriatric Medicine, Department of Acute Medicine, or Department of Orthopedic Surgery.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are 2a) to compare feasibility of recruitment and testing in the three&#xD;
      different departments, 2b) to inform a preliminary evaluation of validity and reliability of&#xD;
      the Danish version of screening instruments, and 2c) to obtain data on variance to support&#xD;
      calculating sample size for a full-scale RCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit participants through a consecutive sampling of all potentially eligible&#xD;
      patients. Recruitment will take place in three different settings: the Department of&#xD;
      Geriatric Medicine, the Department of Acute Medicine, and the Department of Orthopedic&#xD;
      Surgery. One week will be allocated for recruitment in each setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially delirious patients often have impaired cognitive status. Therefore, the process&#xD;
      of recruitment and informed consent is critically important and poses a central issue of&#xD;
      feasibility to be assessed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It cannot be known with certainty whether patients are delirious prior to inclusion into the&#xD;
      study, and even among delirious patients, there are considerable circadian fluctuations (as&#xD;
      this is a hallmark of the condition), meaning that patients may have lucid moments during the&#xD;
      day where they are cognitively intact and may be able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, informed consent will be sought from participants when possible. In case they are&#xD;
      permanently or temporarily unable to give informed consent, informed consent will be sought&#xD;
      from next of kin. Due to the short time in the study for each participant, it is not&#xD;
      anticipated that participants will regain the ability to give informed consent during the&#xD;
      study. However, if they do, new informed consent will be obtained from the participant. The&#xD;
      number of potential participants at each step will be documented to assess problems with&#xD;
      feasibility.&#xD;
