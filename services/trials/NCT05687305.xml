  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness of listening to white noise&#xD;
      on the sleep quality, comfort level, satisfaction level of patients after lumbar disc&#xD;
      herniation surgery. The main hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a difference between the sleep quality of patients who listen to white noise&#xD;
           and those who do not?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a difference between the comfort levels of patients who listen to white noise&#xD;
           and those who do not?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a difference between the satisfaction levels of patients who listen to white&#xD;
           noise and those who do not?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main tasks that the participants will be asked to do will be explained and Their informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained. The two research groups will be compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted with a total of 60 patients who underwent surgery for lumbar&#xD;
      disc herniation at a hospital in Istanbul. Participants in the study who had lumbar disc&#xD;
      herniation surgery will be divided into two groups: intervention (n = 30) and control group&#xD;
      (n = 30), according to the randomization method created with computer-based random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the 1st and 2nd postoperative days, patients in the intervention group will listen to&#xD;
      white noise with a bluetooth headset for 30 minutes before going to sleep, and they will be&#xD;
      kept under observation during this time.Patients in the control group will be monitored&#xD;
      according to their routine clinical procedures. Since there are no procedures or&#xD;
      interventions in clinical procedures, only patient monitoring will be performed. Patients in&#xD;
      the control group will also be followed up at the same times and with the same forms.&#xD;
      Descriptive Characteristics Form, Informed Consent Form, The Richards-Campbell Sleep&#xD;
      Questionnaire, General Comfort Questionnaire,Visual Analog Scale for Satisfaction Level will&#xD;
      be used in data collection.&#xD;

    <measure>Change of Sleep Quality Assessed by the Richard Campbell Sleep Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline sleep quality at three days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep quality of the patients was evaluated with the Richard Campbell Sleep Scale on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd postoperative days after morning treatment. This scale consists of 6 items and the total score range is 0-100 points. As the scale score increases, the sleep quality of the patients also increases.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Comfort Level Assessed by the General Comfort Questionnaire Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline comfort level at three days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The general comfort levels of the patients were evaluated with the General Comfort Questionnaire Short Form after the morning treatment on the 1st and 3rd postoperative days. This scale consists of 28 items and includes three sub-dimensions; comfort, relaxation and relaxation. The scale score is calculated by dividing the total score obtained from the scale by the number of scale items. The scale total score range is between 0-6 points. As the scale score increases, the comfort level of the patients also increases.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Satisfaction Level Assessed by Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline satisfaction level at three days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The satisfaction levels of the patients were evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale on the 1st and 3rd postoperative days, after the morning treatment. This scale consists of 10 cm horizontal lines and is evaluated between 0-10 points. As the scale score increases, the satisfaction level of the patients also increases.</description>

    <intervention_name>White Noise</intervention_name>
    <description>White noise is produced by digitally combining sounds of equal frequency in the laboratory. Then, all of the frequencies in this sound are calibrated to generate noise at each frequency. If the contribution of each region to the noise level is the same, the noise is referred to as white noise. Waterfalls, ocean waves, and wind blowing through trees all produce similar to white noise. Patients in the intervention group are observed by the investigator on the 1st and 2nd postoperative days.Before going to sleep, a bluetooth headset will be used to listen to white noise for 30 minutes and vital signs will be measured before and after the procedure.</description>
