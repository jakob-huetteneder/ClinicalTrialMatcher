    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer tissue sections were obtained according to the inclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      formalin was used to immersed all cancer specimens. And tissues were cut to 5 μm thickness&#xD;
      and placed on glass slides before staining. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited and&#xD;
      blocked by de-paraffinizing, rehydrating, and using 5% bovine serum albumin at 37ºC for 30&#xD;
      min. The treated sections were incubated with anti-FOS (promab 30360) at 4ºC overnight and&#xD;
      washed three times with PBS. After that, it is required that incubation with secondary&#xD;
      anti-peroxidation sunflower at 37ºC for 30 minutes. After washing three times again with PBS,&#xD;
      the sections were developed in diaminobenzidine and microscopic images were made by light&#xD;
      microscopy.&#xD;

    <description>Sixty colorectal cancer tissue sections were included. The tissue was cut to 5 μm thick and placed on a glass slide for staining. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited and blocked by deparaffin, rehydration, and treatment with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 ° C. The treated sections were incubated with anti-FOS (promab 30360) overnight at 4 ° C and washed three times with PBS. After that, it was required to incubate with secondary anti-peroxidation sunflower for 30 min at 37 ° C. After washing three times with PBS, the images were developed in diamine benzidine and micrographs were obtained under a light microscope.</description>
