    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to test the efficacy and safety of the Chinese patent&#xD;
      medicine Changyanning Tablet in the patients with Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel&#xD;
      Syndrome (IBS-D). The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can Changyanning Tablet improve diarrhea and abdominal pain in IBS-D patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is Changchangning Tablet safe for the treatment of IBS-D?&#xD;

    <description>The responder is defined when the following two points are met simultaneously： ① Abdominal pain intensity: the most severe abdominal pain score in the past 24 hours, the weekly average value is at least 30% lower than the baseline. To evaluate the intensity of abdominal pain, the patients were asked to grade &quot;the most severe abdominal pain in the past 24 hours&quot; every day by using the 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS).&#xD;
② Fecal traits: the number of days with type 6 or 7 stool traits in a week decreased by at least 50% from the baseline. Refer to Bristol Stool Traits Scale for evaluation of fecal traits.&#xD;
The response rate=(the number of the responders/the sample size of the group) x100%.</description>
