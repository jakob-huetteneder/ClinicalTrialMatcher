  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process of restarting or increasing lactation in a mother who wants to breastfeed her&#xD;
      baby again after the termination of breastfeeding or decrease in lactation is called&#xD;
      relactation. The research type was planned as a pretest-posttest randomized controlled&#xD;
      experimental study. The research will be carried out between January 2023 and December 2023,&#xD;
      with mothers in need of relactation identified in Erzincan Binali Yıldırım University&#xD;
      Mengücek Gazi Training and Research Hospital and 7 Family Health Centers in Erzincan city&#xD;
      center. The study will be face-to-face, twice a week in the first two weeks of the 1st month,&#xD;
      once a week in the other weeks, and once every two weeks in the 2nd month, in a total of 2&#xD;
      months, and will consist of 8 interviews. The number of these meetings may increase depending&#xD;
      on the situation of the mother and the baby. Interviews will be held at mothers' homes or at&#xD;
      FHCs (whichever they prefer). During the research, based on the SGM, training on the&#xD;
      importance of breast milk and breastfeeding, its benefits and relactation techniques, written&#xD;
      and visual training materials containing these topics, online messages and online live&#xD;
      support by calling the researcher by video or audio when requested, and the breastfeeding&#xD;
      process will be supported. The sample will consist of 60 mothers, 30 of whom are in the&#xD;
      intervention group and 30 of them are in the control group, who meet the research criteria.&#xD;
      In data collection, the World Health Organization (WHO) Simple Routine Evaluation and&#xD;
      Breastfeeding Assistance form, Personal Information Form, Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale&#xD;
      (EÖYÖ), Breastfeeding Diagnostic Measurement Tool (LATCH) and IMDAT- Scoring System for the&#xD;
      Amount of Breastmilk Ingested by the Baby, Breastfeeding Motivation Scale (EMO) and VAS&#xD;
      satisfaction scale will be used. Study; The aim of this study was to determine the effect of&#xD;
      the education and follow-up given to mothers who need help with relactation on the success of&#xD;
      relaxation. The data will be evaluated with the IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences) 22.0 package program. Frequency and percentage will be used in the analysis of the&#xD;
      data. In addition, necessary analyzes will be made after testing whether the data obtained&#xD;
      comply with the normal distribution. P&lt;0.05 will be used as the 95% confidence interval and&#xD;
      significance level in the results.&#xD;

    <measure>Determination of mothers' breastfeeding self-efficacy level, breastfeeding motivation</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The personal information of the mothers who agreed to participate in the study will be recorded, and the breastfeeding self-efficacy level of the mothers will be determined. For this purpose, the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale will be used. The scale consists of 14 items assessing breastfeeding self-efficacy. The scale is in a 5-point Likert type and the items of the scale are evaluated by grading from 1 = 'I am not sure at all' to 5 = 'I am always sure'. The lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 14, and the highest score is 70; A higher score means higher breastfeeding self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Relactation success</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>As a criterion to show that relactation is provided, the daily amount of fluid that the baby should take in the form of 150 ml / kg / day.&#xD;
The amount of liquid in one meal obtained by dividing the number of feedings will be based on. According to the realization of the relactation,, it will be evaluated as partial (relactation occurs but the continuation of formula feeding with breastfeeding), complete (relactation occurs and the baby is fed only through breastfeeding) or unsuccessful (inability to provide relactation despite all the applications), and the relactation response is considered positive in the following cases. will be: tingling sensation in the breast during breastfeeding; appearance of milk in manual milking; reduction in the daily amount of supplemental milk given to the baby; and infant weight gain. Once a positive response is observed, additional milk supplements will be gradually reduced as breast milk secretion increases.</description>

    <measure>Determination of mothers' breastfeeding motivation</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The personal information of the mothers who accepted to participate in the study will be recorded and the breastfeeding motivation levels of the mothers will be determined. For this purpose, the Breastfeeding Motivation Scale will be used. The scale is in 4-point Likert type and is scored between 1=Strongly Disagree and 4=Strongly Agree for each item. Each item is scored between 1-4. Accordingly, the lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 23 in primiparous mothers, 24 in multiparous mothers, the highest score is 92 in primiparous mothers and 96 in multiparous mothers. The fact that the values obtained as a result of the study are close to the highest scores indicates that the motivation for breastfeeding is high.</description>

    <measure>Determination of amount of breast milk the baby receives.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The personal information of the mothers who agreed to participate in the study will be recorded, and the amount of breast milk the baby receives will be determined. For this purpose, the Scoring System for the Amount of Breastmilk Taken by the Baby will be used. The form consists of 5 sections: the weight of the babies, their satisfaction, the frequency and characteristics of urinating and defecation, and the condition of the mother's breasts. With the form, the features of each situation are evaluated as 0, 1, 2 points, and the maximum total score that can be obtained is 10. A score of 8-10 is considered the best breast milk intake, and a score of 0-7 is considered insufficient. This scoring system will be applied in every follow-up, and additional food/food intake management of the baby will be done in line with the information in possible relactation success.</description>

    <measure>Breastfeeding diagnosis of mothers</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The personal information of the mothers who agreed to participate in the study will be recorded, and breastfeeding diagnosis of mothers will be made. For this purpose, the Breastfeeding Diagnostic Scale will be used. This measurement tool consists of five evaluation criteria, which is a combination of the first letters of the English equivalent of these criteria. LATCH's evaluation criteria; L-Latch on breast, A-Audible swallowing, T-Type of nipple, C-Comfort nipple, H-Hold. Each item is evaluated between 0-2 points. The total score that can be taken from the scale is 10.</description>

    <measure>Levels of satisfaction with the education and follow-up of mothers</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>After the training and follow-ups to the intervention group are completed, the satisfaction levels of the mothers from the health care service will be measured.&#xD;
The control and intervention group will be used to determine the satisfaction of mothers with nursing care, such as training, counseling and monitoring provided during the relactation service. In the scale, mothers will be asked to express their satisfaction levels with a number as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.</description>
