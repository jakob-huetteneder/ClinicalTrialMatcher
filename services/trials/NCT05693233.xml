  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to find out what effect there is on the difference in energy use efficiency&#xD;
      and gait analysis when walking while wearing knee and hip assist robots based on flexible&#xD;
      power structures for normal people. Energy consumption efficiency will measure the amount of&#xD;
      energy metabolism and heart rate during walking for a set period of time, and for gait&#xD;
      analysis, kinetic and kinematic data will be analyzed through 3D motion analysis. In&#xD;
      addition, after completing the evaluation, we intend to help in future improvement of the&#xD;
      product by collecting usability and satisfaction evaluation and improvements through&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>① Primary evaluation variable&#xD;
- The difference between the amount of oxygen consumption measured before wearing the robot and the amount of oxygen consumption measured before and after wearing the robot [O2 rate = VO2 (ml/min) / kg of body weight, O2 cost = rate / walking speed (m/ min)].</description>

    <description>- After filling out the consent form for 10 subjects who meet the selection criteria, a total of three evaluations are conducted: one pre-evaluation and one post-evaluation for the knee assist robot and hip assist robot.&#xD;
Pre-evaluation: Evaluation simultaneously with walking on an inclined treadmill (Uphill_incline 10°) for 5 minutes without wearing knee and hip assist robots (speed 1.5 m/s).</description>
