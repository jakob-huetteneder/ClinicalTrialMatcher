  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trials is to analyze the effects of using bougies as adjuncts on&#xD;
      the performance of endotracheal intubation via video laryngoscopy during cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation in anesthesia residents. The main question it aims to answer is whether bougie&#xD;
      use has a significant effect on first-attempt failure of endotracheal intubation via video&#xD;
      laryngoscopy during continuous chest compressions. Participants will perform endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation via video laryngoscopy by four methods in a randomized order in a simulated&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation scenario on a manikin. The four methods are endotracheal&#xD;
      intubations assisted by a railroaded bougie, assisted by a preloaded bougie, assisted by a&#xD;
      stylet, and with no assistance. Researchers will compare the first-attempt failure rate of&#xD;
      the four methods to see if a railroaded bougie method has a significant different&#xD;
      first-attempt failure from that of the other three methods.&#xD;

    <measure>Failure on the first attempt</measure>
    <time_frame>At the completion of the intubation</time_frame>
    <description>An attempt is terminated and defined as a failure when a resident tries for one minute but is still unable to start ventilation, or when a resident feels unable to succeed and decides to give up, or when a resident withdraws a laryngoscope blade, a bougie, or a tube out of the month after the initial insertion. This outcome will be measured based on videos of endotracheal intubation procedures recorded by a camera placed on the right side of the manikin.</description>

    <measure>Failure on two attempts</measure>
    <time_frame>At the completion of the intubation</time_frame>
    <description>If the first attempt of a method fails, the resident will be given a second opportunity of the same method. This outcome will be measured based on videos of endotracheal intubation procedures recorded by a camera placed on the right side of the manikin.</description>

    <description>The time elapsed between the insertion of a laryngoscope blade into the month and either the start of ventilation in a successful attempt or the termination of a failed attempt.
