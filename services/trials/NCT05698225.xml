  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this experimental pneumococcal carriage study is to to characterise rates and&#xD;
      determinants of experimental pneumococcal carriage in PLHIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  can PLHIV be experimentally inoculated with pneumococcus in a safe manner?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what are the immunological determinants of pneumococcal carriage in PLHIV compared to&#xD;
           HIV-negative participants?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how do the pneumococcal carriage dynamics differ between PLHIV and HIV-negative&#xD;
           participants?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be inoculated intranasally with a controlled concentration of pneumococcus&#xD;
      after which they will be monitored for 21 days during which nasal and systemic immune&#xD;
      dynamics and pneumococcal carriage dynamics will be evaluated. At the end of the study any&#xD;
      participants exhibiting carriage will have the pneumococcus cleared with antibiotics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EHPC has been established at the Malawi-Liverpool Wellcome centre (MLW) and demonstrated&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility in this setting. To date, over 250 participants have been&#xD;
      enrolled on the EHPC at MLW without any study complications. Participants will be inoculated&#xD;
      in both nostrils with a controlled concentration of penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus&#xD;
      pneumoniae. Participants will be followed up for 25 days following inoculation during which&#xD;
      sampling will occur at established time-points to establish pneumococcal carriage and immune&#xD;
      cell/immunoglobulin dynamics. After 21 days, participants who demonstrate pneumococcal&#xD;
      carriage will commence an antibiotic course to clear the bacteria (participants may be&#xD;
      advised by the clinical study team to commence antibiotics earlier if they develop any&#xD;
      symptoms of pneumococcal disease). Participants will remain under close observation in study&#xD;
      accommodation for the first 3 days following inoculation, and will then be monitored daily at&#xD;
      home via text message and telephone calls. A final health-check and exit interview will be&#xD;
      conducted on day 25 to evaluate participant satisfaction with study participation. The&#xD;
      overall objective is to characterise rates and determinants of experimental pneumococcal&#xD;
      carriage in PLHIV in Blantyre, Malawi in order to inform vaccine evaluations and vaccine&#xD;
      policy.&#xD;
