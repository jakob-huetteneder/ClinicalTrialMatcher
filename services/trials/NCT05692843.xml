  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a low-intervention phase IV trial. The main objective is to optimize the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with moderate-severe atopic dermatitis who require systemic treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary outcome is the percentage of patients with primary non- response to treatment with&#xD;
      cyclosporin. Defined as fail to achieve EASI-75 (a 75% improvement in EASI score) at week 16&#xD;
      of follow-up. A 12-month recruitment period is planned and about of 100 patients with&#xD;
      moderate-severe atopic dermatitis will be recruited. The study is divided into two cohorts.&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed with moderate-severe atopic dermatitis who are going to receive&#xD;
      treatment with cyclosporin in the Dermatology Service of La Paz University Hospital and&#xD;
      associated Specialty Centers are selected in cohort 1. Patients will receive the starting&#xD;
      dose used in routine clinical practice. All patients diagnosed with moderate-severe atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis who are receiving or have received cyclosporin therapy in the Dermatology Service&#xD;
      of La Paz University Hospital and associated Specialty Centers are selected in cohort 2.&#xD;
