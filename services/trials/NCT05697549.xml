  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is clinical trial based and the target population in this study is patients with&#xD;
      post-stroke aphasia. Cognitive linguistic quick test (CLQT) and Speech Language unhelpful&#xD;
      thoughts and belief scale (SLUTBS) will apply as an assessment. Inclusive criteria include&#xD;
      diagnosed male and female post-stroke severe aphasia patients above 30 years of age. These&#xD;
      participants must have high instance of unhelpful speech language thoughts and belief.&#xD;
      Participants in inclusive criteria must not be participated in any other psychotherapy/&#xD;
      speech language intervention program. Participants must sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
      Participants having a caregiver who is willing to be present during the period of&#xD;
      intervention. Exclusive criteria include individuals below 30 years of age and patients with&#xD;
      aphasia caused by non-stroke etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to check the effects of cognitive behavior language therapy on&#xD;
      patients with post-stroke aphasia. So, it will help speech language pathologists to adopt the&#xD;
      principles of CBLT intervention to treat aphasia that occurs as a result of aphasia.&#xD;

    <description>Cognitive behavior language therapy is an extensive form of CBT. And it is focused on the treatment of speech-language related problems. CBLT helped the individuals to change their unhelpful thoughts and beliefs that cause difficulty for them to communicate properly and effectively. The main aim of CBLT is to use their remaining language abilities, to restore their language abilities and to learn the other ways of communication i.e. pointing, gesturing and AAC.</description>
