      Assessing the level of circulating TCMs (cluster of differentiation (CD) 8+, CD3+,C-&#xD;
      chemokine receptor (CCR)7, cluster of differentiation 45 receptor (CD45R) cells) in early&#xD;
      localized vitiligo cases prior to treatment and after treatment in comparison to healthy&#xD;
      controls. This, in turn, would provide insights regarding the role of TCMs in vitiligo and&#xD;
      the role of early treatment in halting disease progression and autoimmune memory formation&#xD;
      that accounts for high recurrence rate of vitiligo&#xD;

      Assessing the level of circulating TCMs (CD8+ CD3+ CCR7+ CD45RO+ cells) in early localized&#xD;
      vitiligo cases where samples will be processed and stained for CD8, CD3, CCR7, . CCR7, CD45R.&#xD;
      Multi-parametric flow cytometry will be used to quantify CD3+ve, CD8+ve, CCR7+ve, CD45RO+ve&#xD;
      TCM cells percentage, which will be expressed as a percentage from the total lymphocyte gate.&#xD;
      This will be done prior to treatment and after treatment and will be compared to healthy&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
