  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the microbiologic diagnostic yield of pre-aspiration&#xD;
      agitated pleural fluid versus that of conventionally aspirated fluid in pleural infection&#xD;
      patients. The main question it aims to answer is, whether fluid agitation helps to increase&#xD;
      the microbiological yield.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In pleural infection, It is suggested that the bacteria being diagnostically targeted, might&#xD;
      more likely be residing on the pleural surface with a better blood supply and nutrition&#xD;
      rather than being planktonic in the acidic, glucose deficient pleural fluid. The&#xD;
      investigators thus hypothesize that an agitation of the pleural fluid prior to sample&#xD;
      aspiration would aid in achieving a better cellular representation of the pleural space. This&#xD;
      could have the effect of washing bacterial cells off the pleural surface as well as moving&#xD;
      sedimented cells in the aspirated sample. This study aims to investigate whether an increase&#xD;
      in the microbiological yield for infected pleural fluid could be achieved by a pre-aspiration&#xD;
      agitation of the pleural fluid which would have a positive effect on management and eventual&#xD;
      patient outcomes. Adult participants with pleural infection will undergo thoracentesis via&#xD;
      both the standard and agitated fluid techniques guided by thoracic ultrasound.&#xD;
      Microbiological yields will be compared.&#xD;
