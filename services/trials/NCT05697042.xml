    <description>8-week intervention merging yoga and self-management offered via secure remote tools including Zoom (video-conferencing software), Canvas (education software), and Qualtrics (survey software) that can be accessed via a computer or tablet. Each participant will have an initial yoga therapy individual session prior to start of group yoga. Group yoga is offered synchronously via Zoom two times per week for 60 minutes (120 minutes per week). The self-management content is delivered primarily through asynchronous tools that include educational videos, facilitated discussion boards, and interactive activities for goal setting, monitoring goals, and problem-solving practice. Self-management content is reiterated during the bi-weekly synchronous sessions, discussed as a group, and mantras are carried through both practices.</description>
