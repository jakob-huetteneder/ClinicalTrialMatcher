      The goal of this clinical trial is to examine the effectiveness of the Stress Management and&#xD;
      Resilience Training (SMART) in increasing resilience in a population of U.S. Air Force&#xD;
      personnel at Joint Base Andrews, Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Nellis Air Force Base, and&#xD;
      Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. When delivered in real-world conditions, to what extent does SMART increase levels of&#xD;
           resiliency and decrease levels of stress in a sample of active component U.S. Air Force&#xD;
           personnel?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does SMART have a sustained effectiveness from baseline to 12, 24 and 36-weeks after&#xD;
           training completion in a sample of active component U.S. Air Force personnel?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does SMART provided via an in-person/video-teleconference (VTC) or Computer-Based&#xD;
           Training (CBT) modality demonstrate equivalent effectiveness in increasing resilience&#xD;
           and decreasing stress in active component Air Force personnel?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a pre-intervention survey, complete the assigned&#xD;
      modality of SMART ( in-person/VTC or CBT), and complete follow-up measurements at 12-, 24-,&#xD;
      and 36-weeks post-intervention completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare in-person/VTC and CBT groups' measurements to see if a difference in&#xD;
      self-reported resilience, stress, anxiety, or quality of life is present pre-intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A cluster randomized, pragmatic-explorative two-arm multi-site study is proposed to examine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the Stress Management and Resilience Training (SMART) in increasing the&#xD;
      levels of resiliency in active component personnel serving in the U.S. Air Force. The SMART&#xD;
      training will be provided through either video-teleconference (VTC), in-person or&#xD;
      computer-based training (CBT).The VTC/in-person trainings will be provided to a maximum of 10&#xD;
      individuals per session. Participants in the CBT group will be provided a code to access the&#xD;
      training website. A cluster randomization of sites will take place first to place two sites&#xD;
      into the self-selection arm, a pragmatic trial where study participants will choose&#xD;
      intervention arm and place the other two sites into a randomization-arm in which participants&#xD;
      will be randomized into either the VTC or CBT arms. SMART is focused on improving the&#xD;
      practices of gratitude, mindful presence, kindness, and developing a resilient mindset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four study sites have been identified for the study (Joint Base Andrews, Joint Base San&#xD;
      Antonio-Lackland, Nellis Air Force Base, and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base). Simple&#xD;
      randomization will be used to assign 2 sites to the randomization arm (Arm 1) and 2 sites to&#xD;
      the self-selection arm (Arm 2). Arm randomization will be accomplished in Year1, Month 1.&#xD;
      Initial recruitment and randomization will be completed during Month 2 of Year 1 through&#xD;
      Month 5 of year 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Randomization: At two study site locations, the investigators will use a ratio of 2:1&#xD;
      to randomly assign participants to the VTC/in-person or CBT training modalities. Therefore,&#xD;
      the investigators anticipate 84 participants (42 per site) will be assigned to the CBT&#xD;
      modality and 168 (84 per site) will be assigned to the VTC/in-person modality. Randomization&#xD;
      will be stratified with respect to military grade and sex to reduce potential confounding due&#xD;
      to baseline differences. There may be important differences based upon military grade between&#xD;
      the 5 categories of military grade or two categories of participants may select. Under&#xD;
      stratification, 1 in every 3 participants will be assigned to complete CBT and the other two&#xD;
      participants will be assigned to VTC/in-person training to maintain a balanced distribution&#xD;
      between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Self-selection: At two study site locations, the investigators aim to recruit 250&#xD;
      participants in the self-selection arm. Participants will be able to self-select their&#xD;
      preferred method of SMART completion (VTC/in-person or CBT training modality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assure consistent delivery of the intervention, the study PI and the Site AIs&#xD;
      will meet to discuss course delivery, make notations, and jointly agree to incorporate&#xD;
      recommendations for improving training delivery. At the end of the course, participants will&#xD;
      be offered a copy of a Resilience Journal. This book will serve as a review of the resiliency&#xD;
      practices and allow participants to track their use of these practices for improving&#xD;
      gratitude, mindful presence, kindness, and developing a resilient mindset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Site PIs and PI will work with identified local points of contact to develop a schedule&#xD;
      to assure the maximum number of participants can receive SMART during a variety of times.&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained and prior to the delivery of the intervention, a survey&#xD;
      will be administered to collect demographic information and baseline measurements of&#xD;
      resilience, stress, anxiety, and quality of life. Participants will be provided a link to&#xD;
      access the initial survey via the research data capture survey system (REDCap; DHHS/NIH/NCRR&#xD;
      #8UL1TR000041) to provide demographic data, e-mail contact information, and responses to&#xD;
      survey instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REDCap is a secure and encrypted, web-based platform licensed to and managed by the&#xD;
      University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Clinical and Translational Science Center&#xD;
      (UNM HSC CTSC). REDCap includes research tools for project management, survey administration,&#xD;
      encrypted database storage and retrieval, and reporting. REDCap will be utilized to&#xD;
      administer follow-up surveys at week 12, 24, and 36 (if applicable) after participants&#xD;
      complete SMART. The investigators propose to collect the 36-week follow-up survey responses&#xD;
      in order to conduct an analysis to assess the longevity of the effect of SMART on resilience&#xD;
      and stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' e-mail contact information will be used be utilized to send follow-up surveys&#xD;
      through REDCap. Each survey will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes for participants to&#xD;
      complete. If the participant does not respond to the initial REDCap invitation, a maximum of&#xD;
      three e-mail reminders (one reminder per week after the initial e-mail is sent) will be sent&#xD;
      to complete the survey. If the participant still has not responded, no further attempt to&#xD;
      contact the participant will be made until the next scheduled interval (e.g. at 24 and 36&#xD;
      weeks). Because participants' demographic information will be associated with an individual's&#xD;
      contact information in REDCapâ„¢, demographic information will not be requested as part of the&#xD;
      surveys at weeks 12, 24, or 36. All data will be de-identified when it is exported from&#xD;
      REDCap for the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBM SPSS Statistics (version 28 or later) and R (survey package, version 4.1.2) will be used&#xD;
      for the statistical analysis. Initial analysis will include descriptive statistics, including&#xD;
      means or medians, frequencies and percentages, as appropriate, to characterize demographic&#xD;
      status, military grade, duty location, military occupation, and previous deployment status.&#xD;
      Cronbach's Î± will be calculated for each multi-item scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of our analysis include testing and estimating the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention by comparing pre-post intervention changes (improvements) in the outcome&#xD;
      measurements of interest at each follow-up. Analyses will be reported as point estimates with&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals and appropriate estimates of effect size. In this analysis, both the&#xD;
      VTC and CBT groups will be analyzed separately and scores will also be pooled together to&#xD;
      test for overall intervention effects as well as difference between the modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention improvements in resilience, stress, anxiety, and quality of life will be&#xD;
      assessed by separately analyzing changes from baseline to each follow-up time (e.g. week 12,&#xD;
      week 24, and week 36). A joint analysis of the longitudinal trend over the study period will&#xD;
      be conducted as well. The investigators will also consider a joint analysis of resilience,&#xD;
      stress, anxiety, or QOL, as well as, analysis for subscales of any specific domain of&#xD;
      interest. To better understand factors that can impact the intervention effects, our&#xD;
      regression models on the post intervention improvements over time incorporate changing&#xD;
      time-slopes and between-subject random effects. The investigators will control for&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, AFSC, and previous deployment. The investigators will also use&#xD;
      random effects to take into consideration potential clustering effects among the participants&#xD;
      from the same organizational unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the two-arm randomization scheme, the results of the &quot;self-selection&quot; group provide a&#xD;
      window into &quot;potential&quot; outcomes in real-world settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of the outcomes from the &quot;self-selection&quot; arm with the results from the&#xD;
      &quot;randomized assignment&quot; (per-protocol) will enable us to conduct causal inference and use the&#xD;
      real difference between VTC and CBT to inform scale-up implementation of SMART.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Changes in self-reported CD-10 from Baseline at 12, 24, and 36 weeks post-SMART completion</time_frame>
    <description>Resilience will be measured using the CD-10, a 10-item scale derived from the original, 25-item Connor Davidson Resilience Scale. Respondents can answer each item using a five-point rating ranging from not true at all (0) to true nearly all the time (4). A total CD-RISC score is calculated by summing the score of all 10 items for a total possible score of 40, with a higher score reflecting a greater level of resilience. The CD-10 has a reported Cronbach's alpha of .85 and has demonstrated construct validity.</description>

    <description>The PSS was developed to provide both a global measure and a measure for current levels of perceived stress. The PSS is a 14-item instrument, and respondents answer each item on a four-point scale ranging from never (0) to very often (4). An individual's score is calculated by reverse scoring seven items and then summing all item scores, resulting in a score range of 0-56.</description>

    <description>Anxiety was measured with the GAD-7. Respondents can answer each item using a four-point scale ranging from not at all (0) nearly every day (3). A total score is calculated by summing the scores of the seven items with possible scores ranging from 0-21. Scores between 5-9 are indicative of mild anxiety, and score between 15-21 are indicative of severe anxiety.</description>
