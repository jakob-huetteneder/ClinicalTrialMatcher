      Purpose: To investigate the effect of the Symptom Management Program Based on Story Theory on&#xD;
      vasomotor symptoms and sleep quality in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The type of this research is mixed method (qualitative and quantitative research&#xD;
      design together). It enables to strengthen the weaknesses of mixed method research, to&#xD;
      increase the generalizability of the results, and to produce more reliable outputs regarding&#xD;
      theory and practice. The quantitative research dimension is a randomized single-blind&#xD;
      pretest-posttest experimental model with a control group. The qualitative research dimension&#xD;
      is the descriptive phenomenological design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The research will be carried out at Ömürevleri, Atakum, Mimar Sinan, Çobanlı and&#xD;
      Yenimahalle Family Health Centers located in different regions of the Atakum District of&#xD;
      Samsun. After informing the women who come to the Family Health Centers about the&#xD;
      face-to-face research, the research will be conducted completely online (due to the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic) after the verbal consent of the women who volunteered to participate in the&#xD;
      research and their contact numbers are obtained. The postmenopausal women who apply to the&#xD;
      institutions where the research will be conducted and meet the inclusion criteria constitute&#xD;
      the population of the research. When the sample size calculated with the G.Power program was&#xD;
      taken as Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score mean and standard deviation value as 6.57±1.23,&#xD;
      with 5% significance level, 80% test power, 0.700 effect size, there were at least 68 groups,&#xD;
      34 for the experimental group and 34 for the control group. identified as a person.&#xD;
      Considering the sample loss in the experimental and control groups, with 10% more sampling, a&#xD;
      total of 76 women will be included in the sample, with 38 women in each group. n the study,&#xD;
      the data will be collected with the Personal Information Form, the Menopause Symptoms&#xD;
      Assessment Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Story Theory Based&#xD;
      Semi-Structured Interview Form (for qualitative research) developed by the researchers in&#xD;
      line with the literature. As a result of the study, the data will be evaluated separately as&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative.&#xD;
