  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial aims to implement and evaluate a comprehensive package of&#xD;
      digital health interventions for integrated COVID-non-communicable diseases (NCDs) care to&#xD;
      manage NCDs in primary care facilities in rural Pakistan. The main questions it aims to&#xD;
      answer are 1) whether such interventions are effective; 2) how they were implemented; and 3)&#xD;
      whether such interventions are cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 rural health centers in Punjab Province, Pakistan will be randomized into two groups. The&#xD;
      intervention group will provide a comprehensive package of digital health interventions to&#xD;
      connect patients, patient champions, and public health providers to improve the management of&#xD;
      NCDs during the pandemic, including 1) providing training to health providers regarding an&#xD;
      integrated NCD-COVID guideline; 2) using a smartphone app to improve NCD case management and&#xD;
      linking with patient champions; and 3) employing telementoring platform to improve quality of&#xD;
      care. Usual care will be provided in the control group. Researchers will compare the two&#xD;
      groups to see if the systolic blood pressure can be controlled better in the intervention&#xD;
      group at 10 months.&#xD;

    <description>Usual care, which is routine hypertension and diabetes diagnosis and treatment under the World Diabetes Foundation (WDF) project will be implemented. The WDF project provides initial Zoom-based training of NCD care to rural health center (RHC) staff, but no tele-mentorship is offered. Under the usual care, patients with hypertension or diabetes are required to visit RHCs every month to renew their medications and measure their blood pressure. No other interventional components will be implemented in the control arm.</description>
