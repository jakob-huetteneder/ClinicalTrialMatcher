      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of meat on inflammatory and metabolite&#xD;
      profiles in middle-aged individuals after an acute meal. Up to 40 adults, who are overweight&#xD;
      or obese and between 30-60 years old will undergo a consent/screening visit, followed by&#xD;
      three study visits. On separate visits to the clinical research facilities at the Center for&#xD;
      Human Nutrition Studies, participants will consume either 9 oz (250 grams) of cooked&#xD;
      grain-fed beef, grass-fed beef, or a plant-based meat alternative (Impossible Burger). Blood&#xD;
      will be drawn prior to food consumption and three more times after eating the meal at 1h, 3h,&#xD;
      and 5h after participants finishing their meal. The investigators will use those blood&#xD;
      samples to determine the impacts of these foods on inflammatory markers and metabolite&#xD;
      profiles (compounds that circulate in our blood such as amino acids, fatty acids, and&#xD;
      phenolics).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasing number of people is interested in consuming either grass-fed beef or&#xD;
      plant-based beef alternatives, such as the Impossible BurgerTM or Beyond MeatTM, believing&#xD;
      that these choices are beneficial for consumer health; however, little to no work has been&#xD;
      performed to study these beliefs and claims. The purpose of this study is to evaluate effects&#xD;
      of plant-based meat, grass-fed beef, and grain-fed beef on postprandial plasma inflammatory&#xD;
      and metabolite profiles in middle aged adults (30-60 y old). This work will offer new insight&#xD;
      into manipulating the acute, post-meal inflammatory state by consumer food choices. It will&#xD;
      also provide more insight how food-derived metabolites impact systemic metabolites in the&#xD;
      human body through metabolomics analysis. This study will utilize a randomized cross-over&#xD;
      design and every participant will consume each type of meat on three separate occasions&#xD;
      separated by a minimum of three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of consuming 9 oz of the Impossible BurgerTM, grass-fed beef,&#xD;
           or grain-fed beef on 300 min postprandial plasma inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-Î±,&#xD;
           C-reactive protein, and VCAM-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine effects on plasma metabolites (vitamin and mineral derivatives,&#xD;
           polyphenols, amino acids etc.) collected through regular blood sampling during the 300&#xD;
           min postprandial phase (at 60 min, 180 min, and 300 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects on subjective satiety at 15, 30, 60 min and every hour&#xD;
           thereafter following consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete one screening/consent visit and three testing visits&#xD;
      throughout their participation in the study. All visits will take place in clinical research&#xD;
      space located at the Center for Human Nutrition Studies (CHNS) at Utah State University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone Screen (Week 1. Duration: 15 min): Interested participants will be pre-screened by&#xD;
      telephone, using a scripted list of questions (see attached) to identify individuals that may&#xD;
      be eligible for study entry. Suitable candidates will then be provided a REDCap survey link&#xD;
      to complete additional screening questions that asks them further details about their health,&#xD;
      dietary habits, and sleep habits (see inclusion/exclusion criteria). Only the minimum PHI&#xD;
      will be collected to determine eligibility. Responses will be reviewed by a study team member&#xD;
      (all study team members will have completed the necessary CITI training) and potentially&#xD;
      eligible candidates will be contacted to schedule a consent/screening visit. The pre-screen&#xD;
      is put in place to confirm that the participant meets most of the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria before the subject is scheduled for a consent meeting. The phone screen is thus&#xD;
      performed to limit the amount of ineligible research participants that are consented/screened&#xD;
      that could easily be excluded by means of a phone screening. This would also provide&#xD;
      interested participants with the opportunity to ask additional questions about the study and&#xD;
      to determine if they are interested in moving forward with a consent/screening visit. This&#xD;
      will limit both subject and research staff time burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Visit (Week 1. Duration: 1 hour): This visit can be done virtually through Zoom or&#xD;
      occur in person in the Center for Human Nutrition Studies (CHNS) at Utah State University.&#xD;
      Potential subjects will attend a consent session conducted by a trained member of the&#xD;
      research staff to present the details of the study. Interested participants will complete the&#xD;
      informed consent process privately with study staff. The investigators will allow up to 60&#xD;
      minutes for the subjects to read the consent and ask questions. If a subject wants additional&#xD;
      time to think about the study, this will be allowed. The study team will contact the subject&#xD;
      three days after the initial consent visit ask if he or she has come to a decision. No study&#xD;
      procedures will take place before written consent is obtained. To minimize subject burden,&#xD;
      participants will be instructed during the phone screen that they have to opportunity to&#xD;
      combine the consent visit with their screening visit (see below). If participants wish to&#xD;
      combine visits, they are instructed that they will have to perform this visit in the morning&#xD;
      after an overnight, 12-hour fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit (Week 1. Duration: 1 hour): This visit will take place at the Center for&#xD;
      Human Nutrition Studies (CHNS) and will last approximately 1 hour. The investigators ask&#xD;
      participants to come in during the morning after an overnight, 12-hour fast. During this&#xD;
      visit the following procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Draw: A trained phlebotomist (the PI) will draw a fasted blood sample for routine&#xD;
           blood work (see table 2 below) to ensure the participant qualifies for the study. Using&#xD;
           a small needle, 12 ml blood will be collected from a vein in the participant's forearm&#xD;
           or hand. Blood samples will be sent to LabCorp to be analyzed for HbA1C, Glucose, Basic&#xD;
           Metabolic Panel (BMP), and Lipid panel. The blood of women of childbearing potential&#xD;
           will be subject to a pregnancy test (hCG) as part of this screening blood draw. This&#xD;
           will also occur through LabCorp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body mass and height. Height (cm) will be measured without shoes. Body mass (kg) will be&#xD;
           measured without shoes, coats, or sweaters. BMI will be calculated as body mass (kg) /&#xD;
           height (m)2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure: A blood pressure measurement will be taken using an automated upper arm&#xD;
           blood pressure monitor (Omron BP5250). A total of three measurements will be taken and&#xD;
           the average value of those will be collected for participant characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires: Participant will be given a three-day food and sleep log to fill out for&#xD;
           three days prior to each of the metabolic visits described below. The participant will&#xD;
           also be given a food frequency questionnaire once at the beginning of the study, which&#xD;
           will ask them about how often they consume animal products and if they are any of the&#xD;
           following: &quot;grass-fed, organic, pasture-raised, or bought on a farmers market&quot;. This&#xD;
           will give us an indication of the habitual consumption of pasture-raised animal products&#xD;
           of the participants. The food frequency questionnaire that will be used is a modified&#xD;
           version of the Diet History Questionnaire III (NIH) with a 5-point ordinal scale as&#xD;
           adapted from Baudry et al. (2015) (see attachment). The questionnaire reviews food and&#xD;
           beverages typically consumed over the past year and takes approximately 30 minutes to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic visits (Weeks 2-4. Number of Visits: 3. Duration: 7 hours each): These three visits&#xD;
      will take approximately 7-hours each and will take place at The Center for Human Nutrition&#xD;
      Studies (CHNS). Visits will be at least 3 days apart. Participants are required to fast for&#xD;
      12 hours prior to reporting to the laboratory. During this, participants will complete the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meat consumption: Using a randomized cross-over design, participants will ingest 250 g&#xD;
           (9 oz) of an Impossible BurgerTM burger (plant), a grain-fed beef burger (grain-fed), a&#xD;
           grass-fed beef burger (grass-fed). The meat will be stored as 9 oz. (250 g) patties in&#xD;
           designated food freezers (-40 Â°C) in the NDFS kitchen and thawed overnight in a&#xD;
           refrigerator (4 Â°C) prior to the subject's arrival the next morning. The meat will be&#xD;
           cooked on a griddle in the CHNS metabolic kitchen on each side until an instant-read&#xD;
           meat thermometer registers an internal temperature of 160 Â°F (71 Â°C). The patties will&#xD;
           then be immediately served to the participant. Participants are provided with a&#xD;
           standardized amount of water (1.5 liters) to drink during the 300 min post-meal phase.&#xD;
           Participants will be asked to eat and drink the water at a comfortable rate but to try&#xD;
           and finish within 30 min. No other food is allowed to be consumed during the ensuing 300&#xD;
           min postprandial phase. No other liquids are allowed to be consumed during that time as&#xD;
           this would interfere with our protocol (see urine collection below). Subjects are also&#xD;
           expected to remain seated in a chair during this time and can work/read/or watch&#xD;
           entertainment on their own electronic device. Participants will be allowed to get up and&#xD;
           use the rest-room; however, the investigators will ask participants to remain sedentary&#xD;
           otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Draws: An intravenous catheter (IV) will be temporarily placed into a forearm or&#xD;
           hand vein by a trained member of the study team (the PI) to collect repeated blood&#xD;
           samples. The catheter will remain viable by a slow drip of saline. The investigators&#xD;
           will collect four samples total (10 mL each; 40 mL or 2 Â½ tablespoons) on each of the&#xD;
           three metabolic visits. One sample will be collected right before participants eat and&#xD;
           three more samples will be collected at 60, 180 min and 300 min after they consume the&#xD;
           meal. These draws will be taken in a private room in clinical facilities, in a reclining&#xD;
           leather chair. Participants will be provided with their clinical lab results that will&#xD;
           be obtained from LabCorp. Results from bloodwork will be shared with participants via&#xD;
           encrypted email using a USU email account.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine Collection: A baseline urine sample will be collected prior to food consumption.&#xD;
           Participants are asked to completely empty their bladder prior to food consumption.&#xD;
           After food consumption, all urine will be collected in a urine jug (a 3000 mL urine&#xD;
           collection bottle) during the 300-minute postprandial phase to study metabolites in the&#xD;
           urine. All urine collections will be done by the participant themselves in private&#xD;
           restroom facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satiety Scale: Participants are asked to mark a validated satiety scale at 30, 60, 90,&#xD;
           120 min, and every hour thereafter until 300 min to assess subjective satiety after meat&#xD;
           consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary and activity control: The investigators will ask participants to maintain their&#xD;
      habitual diet, physical activity, and sleep levels.TThe investigators will ask participants&#xD;
      to fill in 3-day dietary and sleep logs for the three days prior to their metabolic visit&#xD;
      (see attachments). The investigators will also ask them to refrain from alcohol and strenuous&#xD;
      physical activity (running, weightlifting etc.) for 2 days prior to each metabolic visit. The&#xD;
      dietary and sleep logs will give the investigators insight if lifestyle factors leading up to&#xD;
      each visit were similar and are likely to promote compliance to ensure robust biomarker&#xD;
      results (inflammatory cytokines and metabolomics). Participants are asked to replicate their&#xD;
      3-day foods logs and sleep schedule as much as possible prior to each visit. Participants are&#xD;
      also asked to not consume red meat or soy (main ingredient of plant burger) the day before&#xD;
      each visit. This is done to minimize any prior presence of common red meat and soy-derived&#xD;
      metabolites in the urine.&#xD;
