      The aim of this study is to compare standard education (doctor and nurse led) with Virtual&#xD;
      Reality (VR) augmented education in patients prior toa selective coronary angiography. A 360°&#xD;
      education video was prepared in the operating theatre and other areas of the hospital to make&#xD;
      patients more comfortable with these unfamilliar places. The procedure was explained in&#xD;
      details by a doctor and animations were used to help them to visualise the procedure. Risks&#xD;
      and complications of the procedure were highlited along with the precautionary measures the&#xD;
      patient need to take after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients coming into the One-Day Cardilogy Unit of Podlesi Hospital will be randomised into 2&#xD;
      groups: Standard education and VR augmented education. The VR group will be then educated&#xD;
      using VR and will be given an opportunity to ask a physician more questions if needed.&#xD;
      Patients will then fill in forms to assess their experience, feelings and knowledge about the&#xD;
      procedure. Data will be then collected to assess if VR could facilitate patients' education.&#xD;
      The investigators believe it could be a useful tool to save time of doctors and nurses which&#xD;
      is becoming more and more precious and expensive.&#xD;
