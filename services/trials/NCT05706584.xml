      Depending on the education system, the increasing number of students, inadequate&#xD;
      practice/skill laboratories, a small number of lecturers and students with limited time in&#xD;
      the clinic have a negative impact on obtaining appropriate clinical experience. The virtual&#xD;
      learning environment experience will prepare the student for the clinic in the most realistic&#xD;
      way and will reduce the risk of errors in clinical care and treatment. In light of this&#xD;
      information, presenting the learning environment of the future to the student will prepare&#xD;
      the student both in the clinical practice area and in the professional environment as&#xD;
      self-confident and highly equipped The study was planned with a mixed method consisting of&#xD;
      single-blind randomized controlled experiment and focus group interview methods. The research&#xD;
      was planned to be carried out during the pediatric nursing course period between 2023-2024&#xD;
      Fall Semester October-December. Participants will be students taking a pediatric nursing&#xD;
      course. Scales and Forms to be used in the Study; Informed Consent and Demographic Data&#xD;
      Collection Form, Expert Opinion Form, Proficiency Scale for Nursing Students, Augmented&#xD;
      Reality Applications Attitude Scale, Pre and Post Test, Student Case Form, â€¢ Focus Group&#xD;
      Interview Form and Distance Education Satisfaction Scale of university life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The universe of the research consists of all students who take and continue the 2023 - 2024&#xD;
      fall term child health and diseases nursing course (N: 190). It will try to reach the&#xD;
      universe where the sample selection of the research will not be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the learning efficiency of pediatric nursing students in infant orogastric tube&#xD;
      care application in two different skill laboratories, considering the feeding pattern from&#xD;
      Gordon's Functional Health patterns. (University skills lab and metaverse-based clinical&#xD;
      skills lab) As a result, the learning levels of the students in the metaverse-based clinical&#xD;
      skills laboratory environment will be higher than in the skills laboratory. It will also&#xD;

      Depending on the education system, the increasing number of students, inadequate&#xD;
      practice/skill laboratories, a small number of lecturers, and students with limited time in&#xD;
      the clinic have a negative impact on obtaining appropriate clinical experience. In addition,&#xD;
      from the perspective of Bloom's taxonomy, learning; reminding, understanding, applying,&#xD;
      analysing, evaluating and creating. Due to the limitations in clinical applications, students&#xD;
      often cannot progress to advanced stages from the application part of Bloom's taxonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, clinical application areas are limited within the structure of the health care system.&#xD;
      In addition, considering the developments in technology, it is necessary to include&#xD;
      innovative approaches in education in line with the expectations of students coming to higher&#xD;
      education. Therefore, simulation-based learning has been one of the effective methods in&#xD;
      preparing nursing students for the clinic and profession with knowledge and skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of virtual reality simulation among nursing students and working nurses: Among the three&#xD;
      learning outcomes (skill-based, cognitive, and affective) in a systematic review, virtual&#xD;
      worlds are most effective in improving cognitive outcomes such as theoretical knowledge. This&#xD;
      situation suggests that virtual worlds can be used as an alternative or complementary method&#xD;
      in teaching theoretical knowledge in nursing education and that a learning environment should&#xD;
      be designed in accordance with the innovations brought by technology for clinical&#xD;
      applications in nursing education. In addition, the prevalence and demand of online/distance&#xD;
      education systems in the education system and the necessity of using them in extraordinary&#xD;
      situations increase the necessity of a technological learning environment. Virtual reality,&#xD;
      augmented reality, artificial intelligence and metaverse-based simulation environment are&#xD;
      among the most suitable methods that can be chosen to develop learning, decision making,&#xD;
      critical thinking and clinical skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metaverse is Augmented Reality or Cross Reality (XR) based on technologies that enable&#xD;
      multi-sensory interactions with virtual environments, digital objects, and people. XR&#xD;
      includes Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) (Milgram et&#xD;
      all., 1994). The representative accuracy of the XR system is ensured by stereoscopic displays&#xD;
      capable of transmitting depth perception. XR systems allow active interaction with virtual&#xD;
      items through the use of motion controllers. These are handheld input devices with a handle,&#xD;
      buttons, triggers, and thumbsticks. Using controllers, users can touch, hold, manipulate and&#xD;
      operate virtual objects. This ability enables them to be active in any educational experience&#xD;
      (such as nursing care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of this study is to provide an evidence-based virtual education environment to&#xD;
      the literature and to ensure that it is ready for extraordinary situations in the field of&#xD;
      education (such as distance education during the pandemic period). This should be done by&#xD;
      designing and developing a virtual learning environment. While aiming to make this&#xD;
      environment in the study, was based on evidence. The use of Gordon's Functional Health&#xD;
      Patterns in the design of the virtual learning environment is important in terms of meeting&#xD;
      the patient and starting the nursing process when the student first enters the clinical&#xD;
      environment The virtual learning environment experience will prepare the student for the&#xD;
      clinic in the most realistic way and will reduce the risk of errors in clinical care and&#xD;
      treatment. In the light of this information, presenting the learning environment of the&#xD;
      future to the students will prepare the student both in the clinical practice area and in the&#xD;
      professional environment as self-confident and highly equipped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to analyze two different skill laboratory experiences of pediatric&#xD;
      nursing students (the course and practice laboratory experiences they took during the formal&#xD;
      education period and the lessons and practice experiences they received in the metaverse&#xD;
      -based skill laboratory environment) within the feeding pattern of Gordon's Functional Health&#xD;
      Patterns, through the example of orogastric tube application in the premature baby is to&#xD;
      compare. The study was planned with a mixed method consisting of single-blind randomized&#xD;
      controlled experiment and focus group interview methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of The Research&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To design a metaverse-based clinical skills environment that will provide practical&#xD;
           skills,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. control and experimental groups in simulation environments (control group; skill&#xD;
           laboratory, experimental group; metaverse -based clinical skills laboratory&#xD;
           environment),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Taking the experimental group into a focus group interview,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluating the success and satisfaction of the experimental / control groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions of The Research&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the clinical practice skills of the 3rd year child health and diseases nursing students&#xD;
           be gained in the metaverse-based clinical skills laboratory environment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Metaverse of 3rd-grade child health and diseases nursing students What will be the&#xD;
           success rate when comparing student achievement in clinical practice courses and a&#xD;
           clinical skills laboratory-based environment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can it be used as a teaching method in distance education for 3rd-grade child health and&#xD;
           disease nursing students?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. H0: The education level of the 3rd-grade child health and diseases nursing students in&#xD;
           the metaverse-based clinical skills laboratory environment is lower than the education&#xD;
           level in the skill laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. H1: The education level of the 3rd year pediatric nursing students in the&#xD;
           metaverse-based clinical skills laboratory environment is higher than in the skill&#xD;
           laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM To measure the learning efficiency of pediatric nursing students in infant orogastric&#xD;
      tube care practice in two different skill laboratories, taking into account the feeding&#xD;
      pattern from Gordon's Functional Health patterns. (University skills laboratory and&#xD;
      metaverse-based clinical skills laboratory) The study was planned with a mixed method&#xD;
      consisting of single-blind randomized controlled experiment and focus group interview&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research time 2023-2024 Fall Semester is the period of pediatric nursing course between&#xD;
      October and December. Participants are students taking pediatric nursing course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations and Limitations of Research The study will be initiated by obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent from the students who took the pediatric nursing course during the academic&#xD;
      year. Institutional and ethical committee permissions will be obtained. (No:&#xD;
      E-31034136-302.08.01-649) The research was carried out within the framework of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki, good clinical guide practices and the law on the protection of&#xD;
      personal information will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The limitations encountered in this study are listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sample of the research is limited to the students who take a pediatric nursing&#xD;
           course in the Department of Nursing at the Faculty of Health Sciences of Medipol&#xD;
           University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expert opinions on the metaverse-based clinical skills laboratory will be obtained from&#xD;
           academic staff who are experts in the field of pediatric nursing and engineering.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experience of participants in the designed metaverse-based clinical skills laboratory;&#xD;
           It is limited to the features of the virtual reality glasses and equipment (headset,&#xD;
           controller, etc.) used within the scope of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample of the Study The universe of the study consists of students (N: 190) who took a&#xD;
      pediatric nursing course in the 3rd year of the Teaching Department at Istanbul Medipol&#xD;
      University. The sample of the study will consist of the students who took the 3rd year child&#xD;
      health and diseases nursing course in the nursing department, accepted the study, and met the&#xD;
      study criteria. The net participant count to be included in the sample will be determined&#xD;
      within the current selection criteria and after the G Powers analysis. The sample size of the&#xD;
      study was determined by the post. doc. The sample size will be clarified. With the simple&#xD;
      randomization method, students will be assigned to the experimental and control groups. Even&#xD;
      the last digit of the student number will be randomized to the experimental group and odd&#xD;
      ones will be randomized to the control group Sample Selection Criteria In the sample, it will&#xD;
      be considered that virtual reality users may be exposed to strong psychological effects.&#xD;
      Discomforts that occur in virtual experiences, which are seen as motion sickness or&#xD;
      simulation disease, are among these effects. Simulation hospital is similar to transportation&#xD;
      sickness but going through VR experience. It is recommended that motion sickness arises from&#xD;
      the accumulation of visual and vestibular senses as its organization. It is seen as headache,&#xD;
      fatigue, heaviness, and disorientation in the weight given with the common perception.&#xD;
      Advances in Head-Weared Device (HMD) technology may have increased motion sickness enclosures&#xD;
      due to increased consumers and levels of realism in virtual reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mataverse-based clinical skills lab&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Socio-demographic characteristics of the people within the scope of the research (age,&#xD;
           place of residence, education level of parents)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Health status related to technological variables related to people&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Presence in experimental or control environments&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Professional development&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The nature of learning&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Resources used Designing the Software The software designed by the developers within the&#xD;
           Unreal Engine program will first be tested by experts and necessary corrections will be&#xD;
           made. The software will be developed in accordance with the design-based research method&#xD;
           steps. This method is a research method established to design and develop an&#xD;
           evidence-based educational intervention (for example, learning processes, learning&#xD;
           environments, etc.) as a solution to an educational problem (teaching-learning&#xD;
           strategies and materials, products) (van den Akker et al., 2013). In the design, the&#xD;
           student will be presented with the training of a premature baby feeding on a virtual&#xD;
           screen with an empty platform, then he will enter the hospital room, evaluate the&#xD;
           feeding pattern of the baby in the case and practice appropriate clinical skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expert Evaluation Expert opinion will be taken for the efficiency, suitability, validity, and&#xD;
      reliability of the metaverse-based clinical skills laboratory used in the study. Experts;&#xD;
      consist of field experts and engineering experts.&#xD;
