  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this waitlist-controlled, single-blind, one-way crossover, pilot trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the potential effects of ~8 weeks of chiropractic care on patient-reported fatigue&#xD;
      and the autonomic nervous system in adults with long COVID. This study will allow us to&#xD;
      estimate the standard deviation of the primary endpoint in our population with which a formal&#xD;
      power calculation for a future randomized, controlled trial can be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After providing informed consent, participants will be placed on an 8-week waitlist followed&#xD;
      by 8 weeks of chiropractic care. In-person assessments will occur 5 times: Day 1, following&#xD;
      2-3 weeks on waitlist, following 8 weeks on waitlist, following 2-3 weeks of chiropractic&#xD;
      care, and following 8 weeks of chiropractic care. Patient-reported outcomes will additionally&#xD;
      be sent prior to the first in-person assessment (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Seated resting recording&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sit-to-stand test&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient-reported outcome surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each assessment will consist of the following recordings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Electroencephalography [EEG]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Impedance cardiography [ICG]&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Electrocardiogram [ECG]&#xD;

        Participants will be individuals between the age of 18 and 65 who have tested positive for&#xD;
        a COVID-19 viral infection, or SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, not less than 120 days prior to their&#xD;
        enrollment in the study. Participants may also qualify if they have been medically&#xD;
        diagnosed with long-COVID by their medical provider, regardless of a positive test result.&#xD;
        They must have a T score greater than or equal to 55 on the FACIT Fatigue survey. They must&#xD;
        also present with at least 1 of the following symptoms that cannot be explained by an&#xD;
        alternative diagnosis, with symptom onset or exacerbation after contraction of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body aches/joint pain&#xD;
