      the purposes of this crossover study are to Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the most effective traction force for knee joint that can be used in the&#xD;
           treatment of patients with KOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the influence of knee joint traction on ROM ok knee joint flexion and&#xD;
           extension&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the influence of knee joint traction on the flexibility of hamstring&#xD;
           muscles&#xD;

    <textblock>
      this study is a pilot study design aiming to determine the most effective mechanical traction&#xD;
      force used for knee joint treatment. this effectiveness was assessed in favor of the&#xD;
      separation of the joint surfaces in cm in addition to the hamstring flexibility measured in&#xD;
      cm and active knee flexion range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      according to previous literature, there is no consensus regarding the most appropriate&#xD;
      traction force that can produce statistical and clinically meaningful differences so we&#xD;
      started this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the results of this study will be used to conduct a larger-scale study using the most&#xD;
      appropriate traction force on patients having knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will receive a single session per condition. This session will consist of continuous mechanical knee traction for 30 minutes while the participant assumes a supine position with the treated limb in semiflexion (30Â° of flexion). the treated limb will be supported using the traction bed's table that is used for this purpose. The knee position angle will be measured by a standard goniometer. Pelvis and thigh straps will be used to fix the body and prevent slippage during the application of the traction force. A customized leg cuff will be placed around the lower leg (above the ankle joint), and a traction rope will be extending horizontally from the cuff to the traction device. 48 hours of washing out will separate the sessions of different conditions</description>
