  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle accounts for approximately 45-55% of total body mass in healthy adults and&#xD;
      plays a pivotal role in whole-body metabolic health, locomotion and physical independence.&#xD;
      Undesirable loss of skeletal muscle mass (atrophy) is, however, a common feature of many&#xD;
      diseases and scenarios including ageing, bed rest/immobilisation, cancer and physical&#xD;
      inactivity. Despite the exact mechanisms causing muscle atrophy being not yet fully&#xD;
      understood, &quot;anabolic resistance&quot; (reduced muscle building in response to protein feeding and&#xD;
      exercise) is thought to be key, especially for age-related skeletal muscle losses (known as&#xD;
      sarcopenia). As such, the search for optimal strategies (e.g., exercise and/ or nutritional&#xD;
      interventions) to combat this anabolic blunting remains a hot-topic in scientific research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leucine, an essential and branched chain amino acid (EAA/BCAA), is thought to be the most&#xD;
      potent AA for stimulating muscle protein synthesis (MPS; the muscle building process).&#xD;
      Although, as a stand-alone supplement, leucine is unlikely to provoke a robust and prolonged&#xD;
      state of MPS, low doses of leucine-enriched mixed-EAAs can elicit similar increases in MPS as&#xD;
      compared to a large dose of whey protein. As reduced appetite and increased satiety (feeling&#xD;
      fuller) are common with advancing age, supplementation of a low-dose protein (i.e.,&#xD;
      leucine-enriched) that can adequately stimulate MPS may contribute to muscle health&#xD;
      maintenance in older adults and reduce satiation following a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to examine which of three doses of a novel leucine-enriched whey protein&#xD;
      (&quot;super-whey&quot;) best stimulates muscle building in older adults&#xD;

    <measure>Plasma amino acid concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed over 7.5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>During the fasted and fed states of the study, blood samples are collected every 20 minutes to capture the plasma amino acid concentrations in the blood at that time-point (24 timepoints assessed). Future analysis using mass-spectroscopy will allow determination of the different amino acid concentrations in the blood plasma collected.</description>
