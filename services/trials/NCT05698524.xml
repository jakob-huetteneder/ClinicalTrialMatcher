  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about treatment for a type of brain cancer called&#xD;
      glioma. This clinical trial is for people with glioma who have been cancer-free for a period&#xD;
      of time but their cancer has come back. The primary goals of this clinical trial are the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the recommended dose of PCI-24781 with metronomic temozolomide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate side effects associated with using PCI-24781 with metronomic temozolomide&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be enrolled to each dose level in cohorts of 3. Dose level&#xD;
      escalation/de-escalation will follow BOIN (Bayesian Optimal Interval) design rules based on&#xD;
      analysis of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) that occur within the first two cycles of&#xD;
      protocol treatment. Protocol treatment will continue until disease progression or intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Level 1: 60 mg PCI-24781 BID (two times daily)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Level 2: 100 mg PCI-24781 BID&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Level 3: 140 mg PCI-24781 BID&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicities and determine the recommended dose of PCI-24781 with metronomic&#xD;
      temozolomide in subjects with recurrent high grade glioma, [grade III or IV glioma&#xD;
      (glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate changes in the acetylation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)&#xD;
      histones H3 and H4 during treatment II. To evaluate for acetylation of histones H3 and H4&#xD;
      using peripheral blood exosomes III. To evaluate progression-free and overall survival of&#xD;
      subjects with recurrent high grade glioma treated with therapy with PCI-24781 with metronomic&#xD;
      temozolomide. Subjects with stable or responsive disease after every 2 cycles will continue&#xD;
      on therapy until intolerance or progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To descriptively examine quality of life (QOL) using EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-BN20 during&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PCI-24781, temozolomide, and the combination&#xD;
      of the 2 drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To measure tumor response. VII. To correlate molecular profiles with tumor response.&#xD;

    <description>The incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be described for each dose level cohort. Toxicities will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. Toxicities will be graded on a scale ranging from 1 to 5, with higher numbers indicating a higher severity grade.</description>

    <description>The frequency of the occurrence of overall toxicity will be categorized by toxicity grades. Toxicity will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0.

    <time_frame>Up to 20 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who complete the first two cycles of treatment or patients experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) within the first two cycles of treatment will be considered evaluable. The target DLT rate for the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is 0.25.&#xD;
If the observed DLT rate at the current dose is â‰¤ 0.197, escalate the dose to the next higher dose level&#xD;
If the observed DLT rate at the current dose is &gt; 0.298, de-escalate the dose to the next lower dose level&#xD;
Otherwise, stay at the current dose level&#xD;
The MTD determination will be based on isotonic regression. The MTD will be defined as the dose for which the isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate of 0.25. If a tie exists between potential doses the higher dose level will be selected when the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate and the lower dose level will be selected when the isotonic estimate is greater than or equal to the target DLT rate.</description>
