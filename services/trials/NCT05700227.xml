    <textblock>
      This trial is a single-arm, prospective, multi-center clinical trial designed to demonstrate&#xD;
      that adaptive radiotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer will translate into a decreased&#xD;
      rate of acute (assessed weekly during chemo-radiotherapy) grade 3 or greater&#xD;
      gastrointestinal/genitourinary toxicity compared with the historically reported rate for&#xD;
      non-adaptive radiation therapy. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;
      version 5 assessment tool will be utilized.&#xD;
