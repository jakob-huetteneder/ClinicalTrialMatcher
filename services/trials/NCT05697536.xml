    <textblock>
      The significance of this study is that it may improve the premenstrual symptoms like pain and&#xD;
      anxiety in females with premenstrual syndrome and improve their quality of life. This study&#xD;
      may add to the growing body of knowledge that if these two techniques yield comparable&#xD;
      outcomes and if one technique is superior to the other, which should be the alternative&#xD;
      choice of therapy. Therefore, the study will be done to compare the effects of Pilate&#xD;
      exercises and aerobic exercises on pain, anxiety and quality of life in females with&#xD;
      premenstrual syndrome.&#xD;
