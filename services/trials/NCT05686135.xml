  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) have poorer quality of life than healthy&#xD;
      people. Despite the high prevalence of psychological issues and its profound influence on&#xD;
      quality of life, most IBD patients have limited access to mental health support. As well,&#xD;
      many may decline support if it is offered because mental health is often not thought of as&#xD;
      part of IBD care. Patients may be able to access cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) through&#xD;
      a psychologist, however this intervention is costly and requires considerable commitment on&#xD;
      the part of person with IBD. There is a need for new methods of reaching IBD patients to&#xD;
      provide information on their psychological needs, and normalize the psychological effects of&#xD;
      IBD. These new methods should integrate medical issues with psychosocial issues while being&#xD;
      effective, scalable, and low cost to the health care system. 90SecondIBD is a novel way of&#xD;
      delivering health information about IBD using Persuasive Design technology embedded in a&#xD;
      planned behavior model. This project will investigate the effect of the intervention&#xD;
      &quot;90SecondIBD&quot;, a weekly online health letter, on IBD patients' quality of life and self&#xD;
      efficacy. Regression modelling will be performed to explore the ability of clinical and&#xD;
      demographic factors to predict quality of life and self efficacy scores following receipt of&#xD;
      90SecondIBD educational health letters weekly for 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>IBD specific quality of life, measured using the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ). The SIBDQ comprises a total of 10 questions grouped into four domains: bowel symptoms, emotional health, systemic systems and social function. Each question is scored by a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 to 7, giving an absolute score ranging from 10 (poor health related QoL) to 70 (optimal health related QoL).</description>
