  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical study, in which 150 patients with end-stage osteoarthritis will&#xD;
      be enrolled to ROSA®-assisted knee arthroplasty or conventional knee arthroplasty. Patients&#xD;
      are recruited at Zuyderland Medical Center, enrolled pre-operatively and followed up for 12&#xD;
      months post-surgery. In- and exclusion criteria are stated below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruitment, participants will be invited for a pre-operative visit. During this&#xD;
      pre-operative visit Informed Consent is signed and completion of patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      measures (PROMs) is checked. Additionally, measurements regarding body composition, strength&#xD;
      and fitness and metabolic outcomes are performed. Participants will have a blood sample&#xD;
      taken. Scans, adverse event and medication use will be confirmed. Participants will receive a&#xD;
      ActiGraph for collecting data from physical activity. Of all patients, 72 will undergo&#xD;
      additional measurements (gait, proprioception).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery ROSA- and surgery-data will be collected. Post-operative participants will&#xD;
      have a 6-weeks, 3-month and 12-month visit. During these visits pre-operative measurements&#xD;
      are repeated.&#xD;

    <description>Proprioception of the knee will be measured in a motorized carriage. Patients will lay on a hospital bed where their leg is fixed in the motorized carriage. This sled will passively extend and flex the knee. When patients get the sensation of movement, they have to push a button. The reaction time and the angle to sense the movement will be measured digitally.</description>

    <description>Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty is an orthopaedic surgery that involves replacing the articular surfaces (femoral condyles and tibial plateau) of the knee joint with smooth metal and highly cross-linked polyethylene plastic. The robot (ROSA Knee System, Zimmer Biomet, US) assists in planning and placement of the implants and resection sites.</description>
