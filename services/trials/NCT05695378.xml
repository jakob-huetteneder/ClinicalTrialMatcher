    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial. This trial will be&#xD;
      performed in two part: Main study and Ancillary study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Study: Following a 4-week screening period, subjects will be stratified by MSA subtype&#xD;
      (MSA-P, -C [MSA-Parkinsonian type, MSA-cerebellar ataxia]) and randomly assigned in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio either to KM-819 or Placebo groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a treatment period of 36 weeks, subjects will receive pills of either KM-819 or&#xD;
      Placebo for oral administration every day from baseline visit. Following this, there will be&#xD;
      a safety follow-up period at Week 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary Study: This ancillary study will provide additional information on the continuing&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of KM-819. Subjects in either treatment group in the main study who&#xD;
      complete the study are eligible to participate in a follow-up, all-subjects-on-treatment&#xD;
      (KM-819), open-label ancillary study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in the ancillary study will receive KM-819 for additional 36 weeks regardless of&#xD;
      their treatment allocation during the main study. During a treatment period of 36 weeks,&#xD;
      subjects will receive pills of KM-819 for oral administration every day from visit at Weeks&#xD;
      40.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) scores (UMSARS I + II)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of KM-819 compared to placebo in subjects with MSA for slowing the progression of MSA. The Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) was developed to provide a surrogate measure of disease progression in multiple system atrophy. It is composed of four subscales: UMSARS-I (12 items) rates patient-reported functional disability (Historical Review), UMSARS-II (14 items) assesses motor impairment based on a clinical examination. Each item scores 0-4. UMSARS-I total score is 48 and UMSARS-II total score is 56. Higher scores on the UMSARS indicate greater disability.</description>
