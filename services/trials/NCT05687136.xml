      This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects and best dose of peposertib (M3814) in&#xD;
      combination with tuvusertib (M1774) in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread&#xD;
      to other places in the body (advanced). Peposertib and tuvusertib cells by blocking some of&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of peposertib (M3814) in combination with M1774.&#xD;
      (DOSE ESCALATION AND EXPANSION COHORT) II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of peposertib (M3814) and M1774. (DOSE&#xD;
      ESCALATION COHORT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      profiles of peposertib (M3814) and M1774 when administered in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore correlations between pharmacodynamic (PD) and predictive biomarkers (gammaH2AX,&#xD;
      phospho-KAP1 and phospho-RPA) with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore correlations between baseline genomic alterations of ataxia-telangiectasia&#xD;
      mutated (ATM) or markers of replicative stress, ATM expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC),&#xD;
      RAD5' foci formation with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine metrics of anticancer activity including the objective response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      and progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This a dose-escalation study of peposertib and tuvusertib, followed by a&#xD;
      dose-expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive peposertib orally (PO) in combination with tuvusertib PO on study. Patients&#xD;
      undergo tumor biopsy and blood sample collection during screening and on study. Patients also&#xD;
      undergo positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) throughout the trial.&#xD;

    <description>Descriptive statistics will be used for safety in the Phase 1b escalation study. Patients will be included in this analysis if they receive at least one dose of any study treatment. For toxicity reporting, all adverse events will be graded and analyzed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Type of adverse events, intensity (grading), and attribution will be provided in a listing. All adverse events resulting in discontinuation, dose modification, and/or dosing interruption, and/or treatment delay of drug will also be summarized. Laboratory test results will be classified according to CTCAE.</description>

    <description>Peposertib (M3814) and M1774 concentrations in these samples will be quantitatively measured using a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method. The individual PK parameters will be derived: maximum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), are under the curve (AUC), half life (T1/2), apparent oral clearance (Cl/F), and apparent volume of distribution in steady state (Vss/F) using non-compartmental methods with the software WinNonlin, as feasible. Advanced population PK methods may be employed to assess the link between drug exposure and biological effects and efficacy. The PK variables will be tabulated and descriptive statistics (e.g., geometric means and coefficients of variation) calculated for each dose level. PK parameters (e.g., T1/2, Cmax, Cl, and AUC) will be compared across dose level using nonparametric statistical testing techniques.</description>
