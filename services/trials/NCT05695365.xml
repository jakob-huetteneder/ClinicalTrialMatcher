  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a single-arm pilot trial to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      plausible efficacy of a 16-week resistance exercise training (RET) program for treatment of&#xD;
      major depressive disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resistance exercise training (RET) is a promising but understudied approach for treatment of&#xD;
      major depressive disorder (MDD). The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      recruiting eligible participants, enrolling them into the study, and retaining them across 16&#xD;
      weeks of resistance exercise training (RET) twice per week for treatment of depression. The&#xD;
      primary aim of this study is to determine the feasibility (i.e., recruitment and enrollment&#xD;
      rates) and acceptability (i.e., adherence rate, retention rate, and participant satisfaction)&#xD;
      of running a larger study that would evaluate the efficacy of RET for treating Major&#xD;
      Depressive Disorder (MDD). Secondary aims are to implement and examine the utility of&#xD;
      theory-informed adherence strategies (i.e.,exercise preparation habit development and&#xD;
      ratings, commitment contracts, and intrinsic motivation reflections) for promoting adherence&#xD;
      to exercise sessions, explore efficacy of RET for treating MDD, and explore cerebrovascular&#xD;
      function as a potential mechanism of RET's treatment of depression. As such, investigators&#xD;
      will recruit 10 individuals with diagnosed MDD (via the Structured Clinical Interview for&#xD;
      Depression) and enroll participants in a 16-week RET program. Assessments of depression,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular functioning, physical activity, and health will be completed at weeks 0, 8,&#xD;
      16, with a 26-week follow-up.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in exercise preparation habit ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from week 1 habit ratings at week 16</time_frame>
    <description>To facilitate exercise adherence, participants will develop exercise preparation habit action and coping plans during their baseline visit. These plans will subsequently be assessed weekly during exercise sessions, with participants responding to 3 questions regarding their success in developing exercise preparation habits. Using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Every Time&quot;, participants will report 1) how well they were able to stick to their exercise preparation habit action and coping plans, 2) carried through with preparation steps when their identified cue was encountered, and 3) completed the habit without the planned cue. They were also provided an opportunity to revise their habit action and coping plan if their current plan was not successful the previous week.</description>

    <measure>Change in level of commitment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from week 1 level of commitment at week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to report their current level of commitment to the 16-week program and attending their next exercise session via a visual analogue scale anchored with &quot;0&quot; (0% committed) to &quot;100&quot; (100% committed). They subsequently responded to free-text questions related to what they needed to do or what the research team could do to increase their level of commitment. Next, they answered the question &quot;Will you attend your next RET session?&quot; (yes/no response buttons), and then provided an electronic signature confirming they would attend.</description>

    <measure>Change in depression symptom severity via GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline depression severity at the final assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The GRID-HAM-D is a clinician-completed questionnaire that will be used to rate depressive symptom severity. The questionnaire is designed for adults and is used to rate the intensity and frequency of depressive symptoms by probing mood, feelings of guilt, suicidal ideation, insomnia, agitation or retardation, anxiety, weight loss, and somatic symptoms. Clinical Interviewers will follow the Structured Interview Guide and use GRID scoring, in which dimensions of intensity and frequency of a symptom are rated independently for each item. Higher scores reflect greater symptom severity, categorized as Normal (0-7), Mild Depression (8-13), Moderate Depression (14-18), Severe Depression (19-22), and Very Severe Depression (&gt;23).</description>

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 8, 16, 26</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) is a measure that assesses the types of the intensity of physical activity and sitting time that people did over the past 7 days using seven questions via self-report by the participant. Participants are instructed to report the number of days per week and minutes per day they spend engaging in 1) vigorous activity, 2) moderate activity, 3) walking, and 4) sitting. Responses are used to calculate total minutes of walking, minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week, and hours of sitting time on a weekday and weekend day, with higher scores indicating greater levels of each behavior.</description>

    <measure>activPAL (sedentary time and MVPA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Monitors worn for 7 days following week 0 (intake assessment) and 7 days prior to week 8 and 16 assessments</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will place an activPAL on the midline of the thigh on either leg and wear the monitor 24 hours per day, removing it only for water-based activities (e.g., swimming). For data to be valid, the monitor must have been worn for 20 hours on at least 4 days, including a minimum of 3 weekdays and 1 weekend day. Sleep time will be parsed out from each day's sitting/lying time automatically using PALanalysis. From these data, average minutes of sitting per day will be used to assess total sedentary time, minutes of stepping time with a cadence ≥75 and &lt;100 will be used to assess minutes of light intensity physical activity, and minutes of stepping time with a cadence ≥100 will be used to assess minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA).</description>

    <measure>36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 8, 16, 26</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 assesses health-related qualify of life. It consists of eight scaled scores (including vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health), which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability (i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability).</description>

    <measure>Exercise Identity Scale (EIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 8, 16, 26</time_frame>
    <description>The EIS is a 9-item questionnaire used to assess the salience of identifying with exercise as an integral portion of the self-concept. Participants respond to each EIS item on a scale, anchored by (1) Strongly Disagree and (7) Strongly Agree, after reading a stem that contextualized each item within their personal exercise experiences (e.g., &quot;The following questions concern your personal beliefs about exercise. Please indicate the degree to which you agree or disagree with each statement when thinking about your exercise participation.&quot;). Higher scores reflect greater feelings of exercise as an integral part of their self-identity.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a 16-week, twice/week supervised resistance exercise training program to increase strength. Each session will last ~60 minutes and begin and end with a 5-minute aerobic warm-up/cool-down on a cycle ergometer, elliptical, treadmill, or walked laps. Training will begin with a 1-week standard familiarization process to introduce participants to the machines, teach correct lifting techniques, and ensure participant safety and comfort with each exercise machine. Participants will perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions on 10 Keiser resistance machines (i.e., leg press, hamstring curl, quadriceps extension, chest press, lat pulldown, shoulder press, biceps curl, triceps extension, abdominal crunch), with a 1-minute rest time between each set. Workload will begin at 50% of the estimated 1-RMs and increase by 5-10% after any session in which a participant completes 12 repetitions in all 3 sets. The workload will be tailored based on progressive increases in strength.</description>
