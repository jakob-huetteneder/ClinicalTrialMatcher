      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether a CBT group designed to target IU&#xD;
      (CBT-IU) in pregnant women with heightened levels of IU, prevents postpartum anxiety. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that women with clinically significant IU during pregnancy will&#xD;
      exhibit both significant reductions in IU, as well as a decrease in anxiety symptoms&#xD;
      postpartum, compared to a treatment as usual control group. The secondary aim of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate whether CBT-IU significantly improves and/or prevents depression symptoms,&#xD;
      worry symptom severity, and difficulties with emotion regulation. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that CBT-IU will lead to significant improvements in symptom severity compared to&#xD;
      the treatment as usual control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are a serious mental health concern, affecting as many as 15-24% of women&#xD;
      during the perinatal period. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety during the perinatal&#xD;
      period and its associated impact, fewer than 15% of women receive treatment often due to&#xD;
      difficulties in timely and accurate symptom detection. Our group conducted a longitudinal&#xD;
      study that investigated the psychosocial and biological risk factors of postpartum anxiety&#xD;
      worsening in a sample of high-risk pregnant women with pre-existing anxiety and depressive&#xD;
      disorders. In this study, intolerance of uncertainty (IU) was identified as the strongest&#xD;
      predictor. IU is a cardinal trait of anxiety and has been implicated in predicting treatment&#xD;
      response in non-perinatal populations. However, despite the relevance of IU in anxiety&#xD;
      disorders, our study was the first to assess IU in the perinatal population. As improving&#xD;
      symptom detection through identification of significant risk factors, such as IU, can aid in&#xD;
      the development of preventative and treatment measures, our group recently validated the&#xD;
      Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) in a perinatal population for the detection of anxiety&#xD;
      disorders. In this study of 198 perinatal women, the IUS demonstrated excellent internal&#xD;
      consistency and an optimal clinical cut-off score of 64 or greater was established, yielding&#xD;
      a sensitivity of 89%. The IUS also demonstrated very good positive (79%) and negative (80%)&#xD;
      predictive values. These findings suggest that the IUS represents a clinically useful&#xD;
      screening tool to be used as an aid for the early and accurate detection of anxiety disorders&#xD;
      during the perinatal period. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is considered a first-line&#xD;
      treatment for perinatal anxiety disorders and CBT programs targeting IU have revealed&#xD;
      promising findings in non-perinatal populations.It is therefore imperative to investigate&#xD;
      whether a treatment program specifically designed to target IU during pregnancy can prevent&#xD;
      postpartum anxiety.&#xD;
