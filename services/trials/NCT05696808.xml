  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The modality of lifestyle modification including low calorie diets along with normal protein&#xD;
      and moderate physical activity is the safest standard medical treatment for NAFLD in general.&#xD;
      There are many benefits of weight loss to the patients with NAFLD. Besides the improvement in&#xD;
      the features of metabolic syndrome, weight loss with IHPD would certainly improve the overall&#xD;
      vitality and well being of the patients. The results of study will help to delineate a&#xD;
      protocolized care for the management of NAFLD with metabolic syndrome thus helping other&#xD;
      patients also in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a strong link between food items, gut microbiota (GM), liver fat and development of&#xD;
      various non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The incidence of NCDs is rapidly increasing&#xD;
      globally. The GM is considered an organ by itself and any alterations in its composition or&#xD;
      functioning are likely to be associated with different NCDs, including cancers. The core to&#xD;
      most of the NCDs is increased fat in the liver and the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&#xD;
      (NAFLD). The highly variable natural history of NAFLD reflects the current incomplete&#xD;
      understanding of the pathobiology of the disease. The strongest risk factors for NAFLD/NASH&#xD;
      are unhealthy food items and their metabolites which affect the host and the gut microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Indian food items are known to have strong influence on liver and production of&#xD;
      healthy bile, the 'Pitta'. The influence and health worthiness of various indigenous food&#xD;
      items has not been scientifically evaluated. Their role in health and disease would not only&#xD;
      help in prevention but also management of multiple non-communicable diseases. This&#xD;
      information could also make a change in the social and behavioural attitudes of Indians&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project would, therefore, undertake work on the following broad areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Effects of conventional Indian foods as hepatoprotective agents, producers of 'healthy'&#xD;
           bile and stimulating liver regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Food constituents as therapeutic agents by changing dysbiotic gut microbiota to healthy&#xD;
           microbiota, reduction in hepatic fat and inflammation, improving metabolic health&#xD;
           (reducing sugar, cholesterol, etc.) and reduction in liver fibrosis&#xD;

    <description>The intervention is planned as a supervised dietary supplementation, with a goal of restricting the calorie intake to 25 Kcal/Kg BW/day, with a protein intake of 1 gm/Kg BW/day i.e., around 15 % of total calories from protein, 35% from fats and 50% from carbohydrates. Major portion of the carbohydrates is vegetables, fruits and then cereals (high fiber cereals), more amount of tomato and amla at least 200 gm in a day, protein requirements are met by mainly legumes like chick pea black - (kala chana) and moong sprouts besides dals. Lean meats and egg whites would be allowed as the non-vegetarian source. Milk products used are only milk and buttermilk, curd (excluding paneer). Major source of oil would be mustard oil only.</description>
