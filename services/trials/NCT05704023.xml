    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of daily mobile app reminders to exercise in conjunction&#xD;
      with standard physical therapy on adherence to exercise and recovery after whiplash injury of&#xD;
      the neck. Participants will be divided into two groups, the experimental (Arm A) and control&#xD;
      group (Arm B). Both groups will complete a standard physical therapy program under the&#xD;
      supervision of a physiotherapist. Both groups will get illustrated home exercise programs and&#xD;
      will be advised to continue exercising at home. In addition, the experimental group will&#xD;
      receive one daily push notification via a mobile app to perform a daily exercise at home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whiplash injury of the neck is the most common injury resulting from a traffic accident.&#xD;
      Although most people recover completely, 30 to 50% of them develop chronic neck pain and&#xD;
      disability. Also, long sick leaves and lower productivity at work create a burden on the&#xD;
      healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative treatment includes exercise, physical therapy modalities such as transcutaneous&#xD;
      electric nerve stimulation (TENS), and ultrasound therapy. Although conservative treatment is&#xD;
      recommended, the evidence of its efficacy remains unclear. Education after the injury can be&#xD;
      beneficial in lowering anxiety and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies are investigating the usefulness of mobile apps in various medical conditions.&#xD;
      In rehabilitation medicine, apps are used to increase knowledge about different conditions,&#xD;
      as a measurement tool, and as an intervention to increase adherence to the prescribed&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the enrollment in the study, participants will complete the two-part physical therapy&#xD;
      program (2x10 sessions, 5times/day, 3-week break in between) under the supervision of a&#xD;
      physiotherapist at the outpatient clinic. After completing the program, the participants will&#xD;
      get a home exercise program, group A via mobile app, and group B via papers, and will be&#xD;
      encouraged to continue exercising at home. Also, group A will download a mobile app, &quot;WIapp,&quot;&#xD;
      that was developed for this purpose and will receive one daily push notification as a&#xD;
      reminder to perform a daily exercise at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that daily reminding to exercise via mobile app can increase&#xD;
      adherence to prescribed therapy and overall increase recovery.&#xD;
