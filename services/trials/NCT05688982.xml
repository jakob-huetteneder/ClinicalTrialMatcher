  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to test the impact of a screening and linkage intervention&#xD;
      for adverse social determinants of health (aSDoH) on oral health linkage to care for&#xD;
      emergency department patients. Researchers will compare three groups: Patients in Arm A will&#xD;
      receive paper handouts with general oral health and aSDoH resources. Patients in Arm B will&#xD;
      receive paper handouts with geographically-proximate oral health and aSDoH resources.&#xD;
      Patients in Arm C will receive geographically-proximate oral health and aSDoH resources plus&#xD;
      active navigational assistance.&#xD;
