    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least Minimal Improvement at Week 24 According to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Minimal improvement per ACR/EULAR was defined as total improvement score [TIS] of ≥ 20 points. The TIS is a score derived from the evaluation of the results from 6 core set measurements (CSMs) of myositis disease activity: Physician's Global Disease Activity Assessment; Patient's Global Disease Activity Assessment; Muscle Manual Test-8 (MMT-8); Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI); Enzymes (aldolase, creatine kinase [CK], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]); and Extra-muscular disease activity. The TIS is a scale from 0 to 100 that allows for the discrimination between minimal, moderate and major responders depending on their improvement in the combined 6 CSM.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified-Cutaneous DM Disease Area and Severity Index Activity Score (m-CDASI-A) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CDASI is a clinician-scored single page instrument that separately measures activity (m-CDASI-A) and damage (m-CDASI-D) in the skin of DM participants. The m-CDASI-A consists of 3 activity measures (erythema, scale, and erosion/ulceration) assessed over 15 body areas along with the activity of Gottron's papules on hands and activity of periungual changes and alopecia. m-CDASI-A ranges from 0-100. Higher scores indicate more disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is a generic rather than a disease-specific instrument, comprised of 8 sections: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. There are 2 or 3 questions for each section. Scoring within each section is from 0 [without any difficulty] to 3 [unable to do]. For each section the score given to that section is the worst score within the section. The 8 scores of the 8 sections are summed and divided by 8.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the manual muscle test (MMT-8) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>MMT-8 is a set of 8 designated muscles, 7 of them being tested bilaterally (potential score 0-140). Axial (neck flexors) testing is included, so that potential maximum MMT-8 score = 150.</description>
