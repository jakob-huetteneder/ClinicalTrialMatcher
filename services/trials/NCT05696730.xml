  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a communication intervention about&#xD;
      sexuality on quality of life and other outcomes like physical activity, exercise capacity and&#xD;
      health status in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human sexuality is a universal part of living and associated with quality of life and mental&#xD;
      and physical health benefits. Improved sexual relationships and sexual activity might also be&#xD;
      an intrinsic motivator to stay physically active. However, problems with sexuality and loss&#xD;
      of sexual drive are common in older and chronically ill people like persons with chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In persons with COPD sexuality is rarely addressed&#xD;
      during medical consultations and the topic is not sufficiently researched despite the fact&#xD;
      that a thorough assessment of quality of life is incomplete without considering sexuality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this background, the investigators developed an instrument that supports healthcare&#xD;
      professionals to start and shape communication about sexuality: COSY. The COSY intervention&#xD;
      consists of four tools (communication leaflet for health care professionals, application&#xD;
      guidance, pictorial representation of the spectrum of intimacy for health care professionals,&#xD;
      patient information booklet) and aims to sensitize persons with COPD with the topic&#xD;
      sexuality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the COSY communication intervention&#xD;
      on quality of life and other outcomes like physical activity, exercise capacity and health&#xD;
      status in people with COPD.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CASP is a validated measure developed specifically to assess quality of life in old age by the total score of the CASP-12 (Control, Autonomy, Self-realization and Pleasure) german short-version of the CASP-19 scale; 12 questions; 4-point Likert-type-scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (often)</description>

    <measure>Physical activity (PROactive physical activity in COPD instrument, clinical visit version [C-PPAC]; domains amount and difficulty)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months, measured during 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The C-PPAC is a validated and reliable hybrid tool combining a short patient-reported outcome questionnaire and two activity monitor variables (assessed by the accelerometer ActiGraph®) to measure physical activity in COPD patients in the two domains amount and difficulty; 12 questions; 5-point Likert-type-scale (item scores 0-4, scale 0-100, higher socres indicating higher amonunt of/less difficulty with physical activity)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Functional exercise capacity (1-min Sit-to-Stand [STS] test)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months</time_frame>

    <measure>COPD-specific health-related quality of life (Chronic Respiratory Questionnaires [CRQ] Subscales)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CRQ is a validated tool to assess COPD-specific health-related quality of life with four domains: Dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function, mastery domain. The total CRQ contains 20 questions responded to on a 7-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 to 7 with lower scores indicating worse HRQoL</description>

    <measure>COPD-specific health status / Symptoms (COPD Assessment Test; CAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CAT measures the impact of COPD on a person's health status, covering the most burdensome symptoms and limitations of COPD; 8 questions; 6-point Likert-type scale (item scores: 0-5, overall score 0-40 with higher score indicating poorer health status)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health status (Feeling Thermometer; FT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FT is a visual analogue scale for overall health state ranging from 0 (worst health you can imagine) to 100 (best healthy you can imagine)</description>

    <intervention_name>Communication intervention about sexuality in people with COPD</intervention_name>
    <description>COSY is a communication intervention which consists of one face to face counselling (75 min) and two 30-min telephone call counselling.&#xD;
Patients assigned to the intervention group will get the COSY communication intervention with a special focus on the positive impact of sexuality on wellbeing plus specific motivation for physical activity. Together with the patient, a personalized re-enforcement instrument, the COSY-Compass, is elaborated to set individual goals and motivation for physical activity over the whole intervention period (3 months).&#xD;
Participants will learn to understand the positive effect of regular physical activity on physical, mental, and cognitive wellbeing and a more fulfilling sex life as well as get inspiration about the spectrum and possible expressions and manifestations of caring and intimacy with oneself.</description>
