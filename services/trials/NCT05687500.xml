  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm hypothesis that Glibenclamide can be administered&#xD;
      orally and is an alternative to insulin therapy in treating transient hyperglycemia of&#xD;
      premature newborns.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transient hyperglycemia of premature newborns results from an overall decrease in insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, which is responsible at the beta cell level for abnormalities of intragranular&#xD;
      cleavage of proinsulin into insulin, leading to reduced active insulin secretion. Intravenous&#xD;
      administration of exogenous insulin can be used to combat insulin resistance and lower blood&#xD;
      glucose, but it is difficult to manage in premature newborns and is associated with a&#xD;
      substantial risk of hypoglycemia. Glibenclamide, which stimulates endogenous insulin&#xD;
      secretion and can be administered orally, might be an alternative to insulin therapy in&#xD;
      treating transient hyperglycemia of premature newborns.&#xD;

    <description>The primary evaluation criteria is 72 hours blood glucose control on glibenclamide treatment (success of the treatment). This is defined as the non-use of insulin and absence of severe hypoglycemia (&lt; 1.5 mmol/l) or persistent moderate hypoglycemia (&lt; 2.6 mmol/l in 2 successive measurements (dextro) at an interval of more than 3 hours)</description>
