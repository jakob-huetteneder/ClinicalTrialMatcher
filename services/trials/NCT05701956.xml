  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale: Recently, two prospective multicenter RCT (ATTENTION and BAOCHE&#xD;
      trials) have shown a significantly beneficial effect of endovascular thrombectomy in patients&#xD;
      with an acute symptomatic basilar artery occlusion. The EXTEND-IA TNK trial demonstrated that&#xD;
      intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase is superior to alteplase before endovascular&#xD;
      thrombectomy for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion strokes. The COMPASS trial&#xD;
      demonstrated the non-inferiority of functional outcomes when compared a direct aspiration as&#xD;
      first pass thrombectomy with stent retriever first line thrombectomy in acute occlusion of&#xD;
      anterior circulation. However, it is unclear whether intravenous tenecteplase bridging with&#xD;
      endovascular thrombectomy is superior to endovascular thrombectomy alone in acute basilar&#xD;
      artery occlusion and whether a direct aspiration as first pass thrombectomy is non-inferior&#xD;
      to stent retriever first line thrombectomy in patients with basilar artery occlusion.&#xD;
      Therefore, additional studies are needed to explore the potential benefit of intravenous&#xD;
      tenecteplase and a direct aspiration as first pass thrombectomy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: 1. To assess the effect of intravenous tenecteplase plus endovascular thrombectomy&#xD;
      compared to endovascular thrombectomy alone in patients with basilar artery occlusion&#xD;
      (confirmed by CTA/MRA) on efficacy and safety outcomes. 2. to evaluate whether patients&#xD;
      treated with a direct aspiration first pass (ADAPT) approach have non-inferior functional&#xD;
      outcomes to those treated with a stent retriever as the firstline (SRFL) approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Multicenter, prospective, controlled clinical trial with open-label treatment&#xD;
      and blind outcome assessment (PROBE) of intravenous tenecteplase plus endovascular&#xD;
      thrombectomy versus endovascular thrombectomy alone. The trial has observer blinded&#xD;
      assessment of the primary outcome and of neuro-imaging at baseline and follow up.&#xD;
