  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a 12-week sedentary behavior reduction&#xD;
      intervention (&quot;Sit Less&quot; program) for patients with type 2 diabetes. The program aims to&#xD;
      reduce and break sitting times among this population using an objective activity monitor and&#xD;
      mHealth. The investigators will test the program to help diabetes patients break up sitting&#xD;
      time, reduce daily sitting time, and move more. The investigators will also study preliminary&#xD;
      effects of the SB reduction intervention on light physical activity, cardiometabolic markers&#xD;
      and patient-centered outcomes, and whether diabetes patients like the program and can follow&#xD;
      it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to develop and conduct a pilot 2-arm RCT to test a wearable&#xD;
      technology-based sedentary behavior reduction intervention in type 2 diabetes patients.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either the control group or the sedentary behavior&#xD;
      reduction intervention group. The intervention group will target a 120 minute per day&#xD;
      reduction in sedentary behavior using an objective activity monitor and mHealth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the study aims to: determine the feasibility and acceptability of the sedentary&#xD;
      behavior reduction intervention in type 2 diabetes patients by evaluating reach, retention,&#xD;
      satisfaction, and compliance with the intervention; evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the&#xD;
      sedentary behavior reduction intervention on changes in sedentary time; and explore&#xD;
      preliminary effects of the sedentary reduction intervention on physical activity,&#xD;
      cardiometabolic markers and patient-centered outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Level of satisfaction with the intervention will be assessed by using the 10-item of system usability scale. An exit interview will be conducted by the intervention among subsamples of the intervention group (n =20) during the post-intervention visit. The interview will assess the acceptability of and satisfaction with the intervention, barriers and facilitators to sedentary behavior reduction, and any alternate strategies tried by participants during the study.</description>
