    <textblock>
      This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of novobiocin in treating&#xD;
      cancer patients with alterations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes. Novobiocin is&#xD;
      an antibiotic that blocks the activity of a protein called DNA polymerase theta, which helps&#xD;
      repair DNA that has become damaged as cells grow and divide. Cancer cells that cannot repair&#xD;
      their damaged DNA die. This medication may help shrink or stabilize cancer with a mutation in&#xD;
      DNA repair genes.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      continuous novobiocin sodium (novobiocin) in patients with solid tumors carrying homologous&#xD;
      recombination (HR) or DNA damage repair (DDR) alterations that are poly (ADP-ribose)&#xD;
      polymerase (PARP) inhibitor-naïve or -resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      continuous novobiocin in patients with solid tumors carrying HR or DDR alterations that are&#xD;
      PARP inhibitor-naïve or -resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameters of continuous novobiocin administration&#xD;
      in patients with solid tumors carrying HR or DDR alterations that are PARP inhibitor-naïve or&#xD;
      -resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the minimally biologically effective dose of novobiocin in patients with&#xD;
      solid tumors carrying HR or DDR alterations that are PARP inhibitor-naïve or -resistant using&#xD;
      pre- and on-treatment biopsies to characterize novobiocin-mediated pharmacodynamic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To conduct a preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity of novobiocin administered&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of pre- and time-of-progression biopsies to characterize&#xD;
      tumors for HR deficiency (deleterious mutations/deletions in genes known to be involved in&#xD;
      HR) and genomic changes mediating acquired resistance to novobiocin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) on pre- and on-treatment biopsies, as well as&#xD;
      time-of-progression biopsies for serial analysis of gene expression to identify determinants&#xD;
      of response, resistance, and pathway adaptation to novobiocin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlation of baseline level of POLQ messenger (m)RNA with clinical outcome (complete&#xD;
      response [CR], partial response [PR] or stable disease [SD] versus [vs.] progressive disease&#xD;
      [PD]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Correlation of ATM immunohistochemistry (IHC) with clinical outcome in patients with&#xD;
      ATM-mutant cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive novobiocin sodium orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 of each cycle.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients also undergo a tumor biopsy at baseline, on day 15 of cycle 1, and at time of&#xD;
      progression. Patients undergo medical imaging scans at baseline and every 8 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      also undergo blood sample collection on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 2 years.&#xD;

             alterations defined only by germline testing are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any number of prior therapy regimens is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with cancers for which PARP inhibitors have been approved as standard-of-care&#xD;
             must have received a PARP inhibitor prior to enrollment on this study. Other patients&#xD;
             may be either PARP inhibitor-naïve (i.e., never have received a PARP inhibitor) or&#xD;
             have disease that is PARP inhibitor-resistant (i.e., disease that has progressed&#xD;
             radiologically based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1&#xD;
             while receiving any PARP inhibitor)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;=18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of novobiocin in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study&#xD;

             ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;= 60 mL/min (via the chronic kidney disease&#xD;
             epidemiology [CKD-EPI] glomerular filtration rate estimation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF) =&lt; 480 ms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral&#xD;
             therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral&#xD;
             load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated&#xD;
             and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are&#xD;
             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression, stable&#xD;
             and off steroids for 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or&#xD;
             leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the patient is asymptomatic and the treating&#xD;
             physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is&#xD;
             unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be New York Heart Association Functional Classification of class 2B or&#xD;
             better&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have tumors amenable to biopsies, and be willing to undergo biopsies at&#xD;
             two time points (pre- and on-treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of novobiocin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because polymerase theta (POLtheta) inhibitor agents have the potential to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation and 4 months after completion of&#xD;
             novobiocin administration. Effective contraception is defined as a method that&#xD;
             achieves a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.&#xD;
             (Note: Because of a concern for decreased effectiveness of estrogen-containing oral&#xD;
             agents when given with novobiocin, barrier methods and abstinence are the preferred&#xD;
             methods for contraception). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity who have a legally-authorized&#xD;
             representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to novobiocin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4/5 are ineligible. Patients receiving any medications or substances&#xD;
             that are known to be substrates of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2)&#xD;
             and/or organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1) and/or&#xD;
             organic anion transporters (OAT1 and OAT3) within 14 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study drug are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing,&#xD;
             it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part&#xD;
             of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the&#xD;
             risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving concurrent medications associated with a risk of corrected QT&#xD;
             interval (QTc) prolongation and/or Torsades de Pointes are not allowed within 14 days&#xD;
             of initiation of study treatment. Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated medical reference&#xD;
             such as CredibleMeds or Lexicomp. Drugs listed in the &quot;drugs to avoid in CLQTS&#xD;
             (congenital long QT syndrome)&quot; and &quot;known risk of TdP (torsade de pointes)&quot; should be&#xD;
             excluded. Granisetron is an acceptable antiemetic on this study. If a patient must&#xD;
             take ondansetron, they may NOT take any other concomitant agents which might impact&#xD;
             their QTc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because novobiocin is a POLtheta inhibitor&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with novobiocin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with novobiocin&#xD;
