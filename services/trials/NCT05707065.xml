  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a global healthcare issue that causes increased death rates. Good trunk stability&#xD;
      is essential for balance and extremity use during daily functional activities and&#xD;
      higher-level tasks. The anticipatory activity of trunk muscles is impaired in stroke&#xD;
      patients. The trunk is the central column of the body; therefore, proximal trunk control is a&#xD;
      prerequisite for distal limb movement control, balance, and functional activities. The&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to highlight the most appropriate rehabilitation technique for trunk&#xD;
      stability.&#xD;

      A randomized clinical trial will be performed in which 42 patients with strokes will be&#xD;
      included. The data will be collected from Riphah Rehabilitation center Lahore and Ittefaq&#xD;
      hospital Lahore. Consecutive sampling technique will be used to collect data. The duration of&#xD;
      the study will be 10 months. Trunk impairment scale and berg balance scale will be used as&#xD;
      the data collection tool. Data collection will be started after taking informed consent from&#xD;
      all the patients. Patients will be allocated to intervention groups by randomization. The&#xD;
      patients in group A will be given core strengthening exercise for 4 weeks. The patient in&#xD;
      group B will be given PNF exercise for the treatment of trunk for 4 weeks. After data&#xD;
      collection analysis of pre and post values will be done by using SPSS version 25.&#xD;

    <description>Changes from baseline Berg balance scale is used to objectively determine a patient's ability (or inability) to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks. It is a 14-item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function and takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. It does not include the assessment of gait.</description>

    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline TIS is a new tool to measure motor impairment of the trunk after stroke. The TIS evaluates static and dynamic sitting balance as well as co-ordination of trunk movement.</description>

    <description>Participants will be positioned in supine.&#xD;
first stage participants will be taught to activate abdominal wall musculature. They will be initially trained to perform abdominal bracing.&#xD;
Then positioned in quadruped position and asked to lift alternate arms, gradually progressing to alternate leg lifts and alternate arm/leg raises to activate multifidus.&#xD;
Then side bridges (side plank) exercise for activation of quadratus lumborum and obliques.&#xD;
Then asked to perform trunk curls in crook lying, asking them to lift their upper trunk slightly (15°) from the plinth, hold the position for 5 sec.&#xD;
Perform 30 repetitions of each exercise with 8-sec hold.&#xD;
Maintain normal diaphragmatic breathing throughout the intervention</description>

    <description>Rhythmic initiation (RI) Patients progressively performed voluntary relaxation, passive movements, active assisted, active resisted movements and than active movements.&#xD;
Dynamic reversals (slow reversals) Isotonic contractions of first agonists and then antagonists performed against resistance was performed initially.&#xD;
Stabilizing reversals Isotonic contractions of first agonists, then antagonists against resistance was performed in an alternate way.&#xD;
Mixture of isotonic (agonist reversals, AR) resisted concentric, contraction of agonist muscles moving with the range was performed progressively following eccentric, lengthening contraction, moving slowing to the start position. .&#xD;
Total 30 min for 3 days a week for a total duration of 4 weeks was set as a optimal time frame duration. Each technique was given for 10 min.</description>
