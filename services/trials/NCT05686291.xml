  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the effectiveness of the hybrid volunteer training in Hong Kong is under-studied, this&#xD;
      experimental study aims to develop a hybrid learning mode of volunteer training that increase&#xD;
      volunteering-related self-efficacy and its associated outcomes among volunteer. In&#xD;
      particular, this study compares the efficacy of hybrid volunteer training with the wait-list&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteer training will consist of a 6-module online course, followed by 5 face-to-face&#xD;
      courses. Each module will consist of the key volunteer training component presented in in&#xD;
      written or video format. Materials will be presented interactively to facilitate engagement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mental illness poses a challenge to public mental health services because of its high&#xD;
      prevalence, symptom chronicity, and impacts on patients and society. Although there is a huge&#xD;
      amount of need to serve people with mental illness, there is insufficient manpower. There is&#xD;
      much empirical evidence to support the volunteer programs for people with mental illness.&#xD;
      However, the literature on hybrid volunteer training is mainly focused on teaching and&#xD;
      learning in education, and the effectiveness of the hybrid volunteer training in Hong Kong is&#xD;
      under-studied. Therefore, The present study aims to compare the efficacy of hybrid volunteer&#xD;
      training with the wait-list control group. We hypothesize that (1) participants who receive&#xD;
      hybrid volunteer training will increase their self-efficacy of volunteering after the&#xD;
      intervention as compared with the wait-list controls; (2) participants from hybrid volunteer&#xD;
      training will have better mental health knowledge and less mental health-related stigmatized&#xD;
      beliefs and behavior after the intervention as compared with the wait-list controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteer training will consist of a 6-module online course, followed by 5 face-to-face&#xD;
      courses, incorporating the key volunteer training components, including Keyes theory,&#xD;
      bio-psycho-social model, stress bucket model, recovery model and CHIME model. Each module&#xD;
      will consist of the key volunteer training component presented in in written or video format.&#xD;
      Materials will be presented interactively to facilitate engagement.&#xD;
