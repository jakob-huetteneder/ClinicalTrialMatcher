  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot, open-label prospective study is to evaluate if the effect of calcium&#xD;
      channel blockade on plasma aldosterone levels in people with primary aldosteronism (PA) is&#xD;
      due primarily to Cav1.3 blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be tested by treating participants who have PA with both cinnarizine (Cav1.3&#xD;
      blocker) and nifedipine (Cav1.2 blocker) and evaluating effect on aldosterone levels and&#xD;
      blood pressure over a two week course of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical treatment for Primary Aldosteronism (PA) is currently limited to mineralocorticoid&#xD;
      receptor antagonists (MRA), the most widely available of which is spironolactone. This can&#xD;
      cause numerous adverse effects, especially in men, due to interference with androgen and&#xD;
      progesterone signalling. Hence, alternative drug targets are needed, one potential of which&#xD;
      is Cav1.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CACNA1D mutation in PA affects the calcium channel Cav1.3. Cav1.3 inhibition may offer&#xD;
      targeted treatment for patients with mutations in CACNA1D. Cav1.3 has been a candidate for&#xD;
      novel inhibitors of aldosterone production,4 for which the case is enhanced if&#xD;
      CACNA1D-mutations underlie the above-described phenotype of PA (asymmetric disease leading to&#xD;
      failure to achieve cure with adrenalectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calcium-channel blocker, cinnarizine, typically used for vertigo and nausea, has been&#xD;
      identified to fit the recently described crystal structure of Cav1.3. This raises the&#xD;
      possibility of using this drug to assess the effect of Cav1.3 inhibition in PA. This may lead&#xD;
      to further studies involving randomisation and placebo to determine if Cav1.3 inhibition is&#xD;
      an important method by which aldosterone levels can be lowered in people with PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to explore whether the effect of calcium channel blockade on aldosterone&#xD;
      levels in people with PA is due to Cav1.3 blockade, by comparing cinnarizine (proposed Cav1.3&#xD;
      inhibitor) to a conventional calcium channel blocker nifedipine (Cav1.2 inhibitor).&#xD;
      Cinnarizine is not a likely prospect for long-term treatment of PA, because of its potential&#xD;
      additional actions as well as Cav1.3 blockade, but using it in this setting, for a short&#xD;
      period of time, allows exploration of a property of this existing drug (Cav1.3 inhibition).&#xD;
      Outcomes could form the basis of further exploration of this mechanism for future PA&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
