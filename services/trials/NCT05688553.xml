  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging of the neuromuscular system may lead to an increased risk of falls in older adults.&#xD;
      There are external and internal factors for falls, and lower limb muscle strength and balance&#xD;
      are important internal factors for falls in the elderly. And can be improved through&#xD;
      exercise. Therefore, an important interventional goal in interventional exercises to prevent&#xD;
      falls in the elderly is to promote balance and increase lower extremity muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexi-bar is a device that provides vibration stimulation. Studies have shown that a 5Hz&#xD;
      frequency can be generated when shaken and transmitted to the whole body. Flexi bar is now&#xD;
      widely used in fitness centers or rehabilitation therapy to improve muscle strength and&#xD;
      balance. Vibration activates the tonic reflex, enhances the excitability of alpha and gamma&#xD;
      motor neurons and enhances motor unit synchronization, and this active vibration training&#xD;
      helps increase muscle coordination as it induces the tonic reflex and stimulates the&#xD;
      proprioception of the joint Feelings, these physiological changes can lead to more effective&#xD;
      proprioceptive feedback that improves balance. And because the vibration causes the agonist&#xD;
      and antagonist muscles to contract alternately to regulate the instability during the&#xD;
      movement. In recreational athletes, the use of a flexi bar in a single-legged position can&#xD;
      effectively induce lower extremity muscle activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 12-week combination of balance and strength training in older adults has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in reducing the risk of falls in older adults in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the effect of adding Flexi bar on the basis of balance and strength training is&#xD;
      unknown, the purpose of this study was to investigate the experimental group and the control&#xD;
      group with the same exercise posture and training time, Flexi bar + BST Is it better for the&#xD;
      balance and muscle strength of the elderly than simple BST?&#xD;
