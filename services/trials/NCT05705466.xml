  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates Navtemadlin (KRT-232) in combination with Pembrolizumab as a maintenance&#xD;
      therapy in patients with locally advanced and metastatic non small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 part, phase 1b/2, maintenance study for patients who have achieved a partial&#xD;
      response (PR) or complete response (CR) after completion of up to 4 cycles of a combination&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy plus CPI regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b is a 3+3 dose escalation design that will be used to determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of navtemadlin in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review the safety data during the dose&#xD;
      escalation to decide on dose escalation and/or exploration of intermediate doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the RP2D of navtemadlin plus pembrolizumab&#xD;
      compared to navtemadlin placebo plus pembrolizumab. Each Arm will have approximately 40&#xD;
      subjects enrolled for a total of approximately 80 subjects. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1. This part of the study has a randomized, controlled, double-blind design. A&#xD;
      stratified, permuted-block randomization scheme will be used for treatment allocation.&#xD;
