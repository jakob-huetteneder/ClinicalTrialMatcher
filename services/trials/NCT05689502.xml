    <description>Subjects will participate in 6 hours of therapy a day, 5 days a week, for 3 consecutive weeks. These sessions will include 2 hours of occupational therapy, 2 hours of physical therapy, and 2 hours of guided individual work. Some of these sessions will be in a group setting. The therapy sessions will be individualized to the subject's personal goals and will focus on improving the function of the arm most affected by the stroke. Sessions may include electrical stimulation of the muscles, if it is determined to be safe. At the end of each week, the therapists will recommend exercises for the subjects to continue to work on at home on the weekend.</description>
