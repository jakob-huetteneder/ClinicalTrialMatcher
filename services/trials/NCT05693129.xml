  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, prospective, open-label, single arm, multicenter study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PDx), and efficacy of&#xD;
      leniolisib in at least 15 pediatric patients (aged 1 to 6 years) with activated&#xD;
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KÎ´) syndrome (APDS)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part I will consist of a 12-week period to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with&#xD;
      leniolisib. Part II will consist of a 1-year, long-term, safety follow-up extension with a&#xD;
      possible interim analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The leniolisib doses to be used in study were selected based on safety, tolerability, PK, and&#xD;
      PDx data from the adult Phase 2/3 study, as well as PK modeling data. In both parts of the&#xD;
      study, leniolisib will be administered orally based on weight.&#xD;
