  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to determine if twice daily oral penicillin prophylaxis is&#xD;
      non-inferior to monthly IM penicillin prophylaxis in preventing latent Rheumatic Heart&#xD;
      Disease Progression in children between the ages of 5-17 years. The main objective is to&#xD;
      compare the proportion of children aged 5-17 years with latent RHD receiving oral penicillin&#xD;
      prophylaxis who progress to worse valvular disease at 2-years compared to children who&#xD;
      receive IM penicillin prophylaxis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      GOALIS is a randomized controlled trial developed to provide high quality contemporary&#xD;
      evidence on the efficacy of oral penicillin as RHD prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To compare the proportion of children aged 5-17 years with latent RHD receiving oral&#xD;
      penicillin prophylaxis who progress to worse valvular disease at 2-years compared to children&#xD;
      who receive IM penicillin prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the economic equivalence and cost-effectiveness of oral penicillin&#xD;
      compared to IM penicillin, after echocardiographic screening for latent RHD detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Compare patient-reported outcomes (treatment acceptance, treatment satisfaction, and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life) between children receiving oral and IM penicillin&#xD;
      prophylaxis.&#xD;

    <measure>Demonstrate non-inferior costs and cost-effectiveness of oral penicillin compared to IM penicillin</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The aim is to understand the costs and effectiveness of the intervention. Costs will include intervention and disease specific costs, capturing both health system and family out of pocket costs. Participants will complete a questionnaire asking about out-of-pocket cost (medications, supplies, consultation fees) and lost productivity (including missed school and workdays) due to the intervention. Costs will be measured in the local currency (Uganda Shillings) and presented in United States dollars (USD)</description>

    <measure>Obtain cost data associated with the receipt of oral or IM penicillin in the community from a healthcare provider perspective.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year endpoint</time_frame>
    <description>In order to understand health center and community costs, 10 randomly selected health care facilities (including level II, III, and IV facilities) will be surveyed to obtain direct costs of medications, supplies as well as any administration and professional fees associated with outpatient and inpatient visits.</description>

    <measure>Treatment Acceptance</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment acceptance will be assessed with the widely-used Chronic Treatment Acceptance (ACCEPT) questionnaire, a generic medication acceptance instrument validated for chronic conditions. This 25-item survey consists of six areas of focus: medication convenience (3 items), length of treatment (2 items), medication constraints (9 items), medication side effects (5 items), medication effectiveness (3 items), medication advantages (3 items). Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert scale and scores of 1 through 4 indicating increasing levels of acceptance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment Satisfaction will be assessed with the 14-item Abbreviated Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (v 1.4). This widely used survey contains 4 areas of focus including satisfaction of treatment effectiveness (3 items), satisfaction with treatment side effects (5 items), satisfaction with treatment convenience (3 items), and a global treatment satisfaction (3 items). Scores are then transformed to a score of 0-100 to create the overall scale score and the subcategory scores, with higher scores representing higher treatment satisfaction on that domain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Health Related Quality of Life will be measured using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 Generic Core (PedsQL 4.0) questionnaire. The PedsQLTM4.0 is a 23-item survey for children aged 5-18 which assesses HRQOL. It has four areas of focus: Physical functioning (8 items), emotional functioning (5 items), social functioning (5 items), school functioning (5 items). Each item has five possible responses measuring the extent to which the item was a problem during the past month. The possible responses are measured using a 5-point Likert scale from 0=never a problem to 4 = almost always a problem. These reverse scaled scores are then transformed to a score of 0-100 to create the overall scaled score and the subcategory scores, with higher scores representing better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Interviews will be used to collect qualitative data around participants perceptions of the impact of RHD and its treatment on their activities of daily living and quality of life including experiences with IM or oral penicillin prophylaxis.</description>
