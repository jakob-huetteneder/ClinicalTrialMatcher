  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to investigate whether acute and 12-weeks daily intake of&#xD;
      Nordic berries can improve cognitive abilities of adults without cognitive disease, and&#xD;
      whether the effect can be linked to changes in metabolic parameters.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted with a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group (2 arms)&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, single-center interventional design. The aim is to investigate the&#xD;
      effects on cognitive function and cardiometabolic risk markers after acute and 12 weeks daily&#xD;
      intake of a berry product vs. a reference product. The reference will be isocaloric and&#xD;
      matched in taste, appearance, volume and macronutrient composition to the active berry&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups, each of 30 volunteers, are studied. One group of volunteers will consume the&#xD;
      berry product while the other group act as control and will consume the reference product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each volunteer will be seen for a screening visit as well as one pre- and one&#xD;
      post-intervention visit at the clinic. In addition, there will be 2 follow-up calls in&#xD;
      between visits. Pre- and post intervention visits will include cognitive assessment with the&#xD;
      CANTAB battery (episodic memory and verbal recognition memory), as well as additional&#xD;
      cognitive and behavioral tests. Cardiometabolic parameters will be addressed (plasma glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, inflammatory markers, blood lipids, body composition) and fecal samples collected.&#xD;
