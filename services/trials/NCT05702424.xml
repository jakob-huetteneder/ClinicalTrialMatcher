  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and PK of IGM-7354 in participants with relapsed and/or refractory&#xD;
      tumors. The study design consists of a dose-escalation stage and dose-expansion stage. Study&#xD;
      participation will consist of a 28-day screening period, a treatment period, and a safety&#xD;
      follow-up period 90-days after the last dose.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage. The&#xD;
      escalation stage will investigate single agent IGM-7354 safety and tolerability in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed and/or refractory solid tumors. The dose expansion serial biopsy cohort will&#xD;
      assess the intra-tumoral PD changes related to the activity of IGM-7354.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IGM-7354 will be administered intravenously (IV).&#xD;
