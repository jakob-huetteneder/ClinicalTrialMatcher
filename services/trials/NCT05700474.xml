  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this treatment study is to learn about the mental health, substance use and&#xD;
      physical health outcomes associated with participating in the EASE holistic behavioral health&#xD;
      and wellness program for individuals identifying as LGBTQ+ and/or living with HIV. The main&#xD;
      questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do important health outcomes, including substance use, mental health and social support&#xD;
           related outcomes of individuals living with HIV and/or identifying as LGBTQ who&#xD;
           participated in the holistic behavioral health and wellness program change after study&#xD;
           participation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does a tailored approach to meet the specific needs of different subpopulations&#xD;
           including 1) older (40+) PLWH and/or LGBTQ individuals with or at risk for additional&#xD;
           health comorbidities and 2) PLWH and/or LGBTQ young adults (18-40) improve health&#xD;
           outcomes including improvement in health and health behaviors .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participate in 6 months of behavioral health treatment tailored to their needs, which&#xD;
           may include individual counseling, group counseling, case management, peer support, and&#xD;
           related education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete surveys at the time of study entry and 6 months later to measure changes in&#xD;
           health outcomes over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enhancing Wellness through Affirming Services and Education (EASE) is a comprehensive&#xD;
      behavioral health program aimed at improving health outcomes for individuals living with HIV&#xD;
      and individuals in the LGBT community in Charlotte NC. Over the course of the proposed&#xD;
      five-year program, 200 clients will receive an array of services to address substance use and&#xD;
      mental health as well as underlying conditions including trauma, minority stress,&#xD;
      comorbidities, stigma, and life instability (i.e. unstable housing, lack of access to medical&#xD;
      care, employment barriers, and isolation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EASE is a collaboration led by the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research with&#xD;
      county and community partners including Mecklenburg County Community Support Services, RAIN,&#xD;
      and individual therapists. Service offered will include evidence-based individual and group&#xD;
      therapy, case management, peer programming, psychoeducation, and comorbidity management&#xD;
      education. Building on previously successful programming, EASE will serve two client&#xD;
      populations with tailored programs to meet their distinct needs. One track will serve an&#xD;
      older population (over 40) with current drug use and living with or at higher risk of HIV to&#xD;
      address substance use along with mental health and medical co-morbidities. A focus on overall&#xD;
      wellness addressing stress management, nutrition, and chronic illness management will&#xD;
      dovetail with substance use and mental health treatment to engage clients in whole body/mind&#xD;
      wellness. The second track will serve minority LGBTQ+ adults, primarily adults under 40 to&#xD;
      meet their specific mental and physical health needs addressing substance use, mental health,&#xD;
      intersectional stress, gender-affirming health care, life skills development and sexual&#xD;
      health . The LGBTQ+ community, particularly minority communities, has experienced more&#xD;
      isolation and worse outcomes during the COVID pandemic; this track aims to address the&#xD;
      behavioral health of this population by supporting overall wellbeing. Programmatic outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed through two secure online surveys completed by participants at baseline and&#xD;
      six months after baseline.&#xD;
