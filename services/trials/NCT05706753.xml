  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of milvexian given for approximately 2&#xD;
      weeks on (a) how the liver metabolizes other drugs (in this case one called midazolam), and&#xD;
      (b) the pharmacokinetics (the way the body absorbs, distributes, and gets rid of a drug) of&#xD;
      an oral contraceptive pill in healthy adult females.&#xD;
