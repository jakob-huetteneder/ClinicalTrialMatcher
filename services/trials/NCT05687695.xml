      A randomized controlled trial will be conducted at the Isokinetic laboratory, Faculty of&#xD;
      Physical Therapy, Cairo University, to investigate the effect of backward walking training on&#xD;
      core muscles strength and endurance, pain severity, and disability level in subjects with&#xD;
      NSLBP. Sixty females clinically diagnosed with nonspecific low back pain with age range from&#xD;
      18-45 years will participate in the study. They will be randomly assigned into 3 groups&#xD;
      according to the received intervention; backward walking group (BWG), core stability group&#xD;
      (CSG), and control group (CG). The isokinetic strength of trunk muscles, and hip extensors&#xD;
      and abductors will be evaluated in a concentric mode of muscle contraction. McGill's core&#xD;
      endurance tests will be used to examine participants' core endurance. The visual analog scale&#xD;
      will be used for measuring the pain intensity. The oswestry disability index will be used to&#xD;
      assess pain related disability and quality of life in subjects with LBP.&#xD;

    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale will be used for measuring the pain intensity. It consists of a line, 10 cm long, whose ends are labeled as; no pain and very extreme pain. The line is marked for each 1 cm without any label. Patients are simply asked to indicate which point along the line that best represents their pain intensity. The distance from the &quot;no pain&quot; end to the mark made by the patient will be measured as the patient pain intensity score. VAS is a valid and reliable tool for pain measurement</description>

    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index 10 criteria will be used to assess the degree of functional impairment includes pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life (if applicable), social life, and travelling. The ODI scores is expressed in percentages and ranges from 0 (minimum disability) to 100 % (maximum disability).&#xD;
For each section the total possible score is 5: if the first statement is marked the section score= 0; if the last statement is marked, it= 5. For example, if all 10 sections are completed the score is calculated as follows: 16 (total scored) รท 50 (total possible score) x 100 = 32%. If one section is missed or not applicable the score is calculated as follows: 16 (total scored) รท 45 (total possible score) x 100 = 35.5%.</description>
