  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early life adversity can affect children's physical and mental health. The Resilience Clinic&#xD;
      is a support program for young children and their caregivers who have been exposed to&#xD;
      significant adversity, aiming to prevent the harmful effects of stress and improve child&#xD;
      health, behavior, and development while also reducing caregiver stress. This study seeks to&#xD;
      evaluate the Resilience Clinic, assessing the intervention's impact on child health,&#xD;
      behavior, and development and caregiver stress and mental health.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early-life trauma and related adversities are prevalent and associated with negative health,&#xD;
      developmental, and behavioral outcomes in children. Research to design and test practical,&#xD;
      scalable healthcare interventions that mitigate toxic stress is needed to promote improved&#xD;
      health and developmental outcomes in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Resilience Clinic is an interactive, caregiver-child psychoeducational intervention for&#xD;
      parents and other adult caregivers of young children (ages 0-5 years) with exposure to&#xD;
      traumatic events or other significant adversity. The aim of this primary-care based&#xD;
      intervention is to prevent or mitigate the toxic stress response, thus promoting child&#xD;
      resilience in the face of adversity, with the goal of improving child health, behavioral, and&#xD;
      developmental outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the the efficacy and operational feasibility of&#xD;
      the revised Resilience Clinic (RC). This is a non-randomized clinical trial comparing&#xD;
      intervention caregiver-child dyads to a prospective control group drawn from a concurrent&#xD;
      clinical trial (NCT05259436, The Collaborative Approach to Examining Adversity and Building&#xD;
      Resilience Study (CARE), PI Thakur). In the intervention group, we will conduct pre-post&#xD;
      intervention comparisons along with comparisons between the intervention group and the&#xD;
      control group drawn from the CARE study. A subgroup analysis will compare two intervention&#xD;
      arms (clinic based vs community-based intervention) to each other and the control condition.&#xD;
      This clinical trial is supplemented by a mixed-methods quality improvement (QI) tools,&#xD;
      including process measures (attendance and billing/claims data) to evaluate operational and&#xD;
      financial feasibility; participant surveys/interviews/focus groups to assess acceptability;&#xD;
      and analysis of quality improvement meeting notes.&#xD;
