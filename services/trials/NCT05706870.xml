    <textblock>
      This Phase II study was designed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled and 3-parallel arm, to assess clinical efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      tolerabilityGN-037 versus clobetasol 17-propionate and placebo in patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      mild to moderate plaque psoriasis at least 6 months ago&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 190 patients aged between 18-65 years diagnosed with plaque psoriasis are planned&#xD;
      to be included in the study. The study consists of three periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period: Within 28 days before baseline visit (-28 days to 0 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period: 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up period with observation: 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned to last a maximum of 12 weeks for each patient. Study consists of 6&#xD;
      visits: baseline (day 1), week 2 and week 4, and week 6 and week 8, which is a follow-up&#xD;
      period with observation.&#xD;

    <description>The PGA is a static 6-point (0-5) morphological assessment of overall disease severity, as determined by the investigator, using the clinical characteristics of erythema, scaling, and plaque thickness/elevation as guidelines.

    <measure>Difference in Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) from baseline at week 4 in each arm</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI scoring system takes into account the overall severity of erythema (redness), induration (plaque thickness), and scale, and the extent of %Body Surface Area affected with psoriasis. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. PASI is a static assessment made without reference to previous scores.</description>

    <description>For TPSS, all target lesions were scored individually for signs of induration, scaling, and erythema using a 5-point severity scale: 0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = very severe. A negative percent change indicates better outcome.</description>
