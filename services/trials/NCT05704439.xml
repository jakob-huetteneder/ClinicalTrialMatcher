  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a disabling and lethal neurological disease which affect 3.47 million Americans.&#xD;
      Significant health care disparities exist in people with epilepsy (PWE). Hypertension and&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia are highly prevalent and often go undertreated, and cardiovascular (CV)&#xD;
      mortality is higher in people with epilepsy (PWE) than the general population. Preliminary&#xD;
      data from our group shows that PWE have higher ACC-ASCVD risk scores than an age matched&#xD;
      NHANES cohort without epilepsy. Preliminary data also demonstrate mortality rates in PWE due&#xD;
      to hypertension, stroke, and diabetes are rising in the US, counter to the US general&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal seeks to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a new&#xD;
      care model for the underserved PWE in a public health setting. In this new model,&#xD;
      neurologists guided by standardized treatment algorithms (ACC-ASCVD estimator+) propose and&#xD;
      initiate pharmacological interventions for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a disabling and lethal neurological disease which affect 3.47 million Americans.&#xD;
      Significant health care disparities exist in people with epilepsy (PWE). PWE are more likely&#xD;
      to be Hispanic, Black, developmentally disabled and unemployed. Hypertension and&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia are highly prevalent and often go undertreated, and cardiovascular (CV)&#xD;
      mortality is higher in people with epilepsy (PWE) than the general population. Preliminary&#xD;
      data from our group shows that PWE have higher ACC-ASCVD risk scores than an age matched&#xD;
      NHANES cohort without epilepsy. Preliminary data also demonstrate mortality rates in PWE due&#xD;
      to hypertension, stroke, and diabetes are rising in the US, counter to the US general&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PWE on Medicaid, Medi-Cal and without insurance are more likely to experience delays to&#xD;
      treatment and follow aberrant care pathways. Unexpected seizures and status epilepticus often&#xD;
      result in transport to community and public health hospitals, where they are referred to&#xD;
      neurology clinics, a process which may bypass primary care. As a result, PWE may have as&#xD;
      their primary point of contact neurologists who traditionally do no monitor or treat&#xD;
      hypertension or hyperlipidemia. This leads to gaps in care and missed opportunities to reduce&#xD;
      CV risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal seeks to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a new&#xD;
      care model for the underserved PWE in a public health setting. In this new model,&#xD;
      neurologists guided by standardized treatment algorithms (ACC-ASCVD estimator+) propose and&#xD;
      initiate pharmacological interventions for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose enrolling 150 subjects ages 40-79 with untreated or incompletely treated&#xD;
      hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to Neurologist-initiated&#xD;
      treatment (Model 1) versus usual care (Model 2). Subjects will be evaluated for blood&#xD;
      pressure, blood chemistries, lipids, and HgA1C at baseline, one and three months. At&#xD;
      3-months, subjects randomized to usual care (Model 2) will be offered treatment if not yet&#xD;
      initiated by primary care. If successful, results of this pilot study will provide needed&#xD;
      feasibility and preliminary efficacy data for a large multicenter randomized trial of&#xD;
      Neurologist initiated treatment of cardiovascular risk in the underserved with epilepsy&#xD;
