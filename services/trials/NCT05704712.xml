  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to test financial incentive&#xD;
      programs (versus control) to promote physical activity among 330 adults who have a YMCA&#xD;
      membership. Participants will have the opportunity to earn up to $100 or $200 (depending on&#xD;
      the condition they are assigned to) for attending at least 50 sessions at the YMCA over 6&#xD;
      months. Participants will have two 6-month windows during which they will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to earn the incentive. In addition to the incentives, participants will complete&#xD;
      research assessments every 3 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life and Health Status (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, and months 3, 6, 9, and 12.</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L comprises a short descriptive system questionnaire and a visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) that are cognitively undemanding, taking only a few minutes to complete. The questionnaire provides a simple descriptive profile of a respondent's health state. The EQ VAS provides an alternative way to elicit an individual's rating of their own overall current health. When the descriptive system profile is linked to a 'value set', a single summary index value for health status is derived that can be used in economic evaluations of health-care interventions. A value set provides values (weights) for each health state description according to the preferences of the general population of a country/region. Value sets for the EQ-5D-5L and 3L versions are available in a large and growing number of countries.</description>
