  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In severe refractory sarcoidosis not responding to conventional immunosuppressive treatment,&#xD;
      the third-line tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor infliximab is an alternative.&#xD;
      Treatment duration is not known, although it has been suggested that relapse rates after&#xD;
      withdrawal could be high. We hypothesize that a prolonged course of TNF-alpha would be better&#xD;
      for maintaining remission in sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population consists of histologically-proven adults sarcoidosis patients who were treated&#xD;
      with infliximab and are in remission for at least 6 months with less than or equal to 10&#xD;
      milligrams of steroids (prednisone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a phase 3, prospective, randomized, parallel groups, comparative,&#xD;
      open-labelled 2 arms study superiority trial comparing a STOP to a REMAIN strategy. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized in the 2 groups in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;

      The screening visit takes place between 60 days and until the baseline visit. The&#xD;
      investigator will first check that the patient meets the inclusion criteria and does not&#xD;
      present exclusion criteria. Before enrolment and randomization, all patients will receive&#xD;
      comprehensive information and provide written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up Visits In the REMAIN arm: visits will be performed each 4-8 weeks depending on&#xD;
           the infliximab interval. In the STOP arm, visits will be performed every 8 weeks, and in&#xD;
           case of relapse (until M12+/- 2 weeks).&#xD;

Major organs are nervous system, heart, kidneys, muscles and lungs. Mild treatment intensification is defined by increasing the dosage of steroids at more than 20 milligrams/day.&#xD;
The primary criterion will be assessed at each visit, in case of relapse and at the end of follow-up (M12).</description>
