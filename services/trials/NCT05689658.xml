      To structure a Brazilian Diabetes Prevention Program based on guidance for changing lifestyle&#xD;
      promoted by the American Diabetes Prevention Program, using materials already developed by&#xD;
      the Brazilian Ministry of Health and contextualizing it to the Brazilian Public Health System&#xD;
      (SUS) and evaluating its effectiveness in a multicentric randomized clinical trial with 220&#xD;
      pre-diabetic patients and a follow up of 3 months. Outcomes are diet quality and time of&#xD;
      physical activity. Health care professionals' perceptions regarding its incorporation into&#xD;
      clinical practice will also be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric randomized clinical study coordinated by the Hospital Beneficência&#xD;
      Portuguesa in São Paulo-Brazil and made possible by PROADI-SUS (SUS Institutional Development&#xD;
      Support Program).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's objective is the Brazilian Diabetes Prevention Program development based on&#xD;
      guidance for changing lifestyle promoted by the American Diabetes Prevention Program, using&#xD;
      materials already developed by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and contextualizing it to the&#xD;
      Brazilian Public Health System (SUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program will not include a multidisciplinary orientation, but the prescription will have&#xD;
      a multi-professional vision. The objective is to bring the multi-team together to discuss&#xD;
      different aspects of the same intervention, such as accessibility, motivation, contexts, and&#xD;
      needs, so that the program, to be guided by the nutritionist, can also be recognized and&#xD;
      supported by the other teammates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the program is defined, the research teams from the collaborating centers will be&#xD;
      trained and qualified. 220 individuals with pre-diabetes will be included in the study and&#xD;
      followed for 3 months. Outcomes are diet quality and time of physical activity. Health care&#xD;
      professionals' perceptions regarding its incorporation into clinical practice will also be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

For the qualitative data, thematic content analysis will be performed with the transcription of the focus groups. This analysis will serve to describe and understand perceptions, interpretations and beliefs from the perspective of managers and professionals about the intervention. The thematic nuclei will be defined a posteriori according to the references of models and implementation frameworks also used for the realization of the focus groups</description>

In order to reach the weight loss goal estimated at 0.5 to 1 Kg per week and 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week, the program will offer individual and group visits, qualitative guidelines for improving diet, lifestyle and self-care.</description>
