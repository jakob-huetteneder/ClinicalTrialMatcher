  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is part of the NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative&#xD;
      (https://heal.nih.gov/). This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) is part of phase 1 of a&#xD;
      two-phase, 5-year project with the overarching goal of testing a decision aid (DA)/coaching&#xD;
      intervention, tailored to Black patients with comorbid chronic pain and depression, to&#xD;
      encourage use of and adherence to nonpharmacological pain treatments (NPTs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 2-arm pilot trial will aim to enroll up to 40 Black patients with comorbid chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain and depression in primary care from an urban safety-net health system&#xD;
      with the end goal of at least 30 patients completing the trial. After the baseline&#xD;
      assessment, patients randomized to the intervention will be asked to participate in 4&#xD;
      coaching sessions over approximately 12 weeks. Sessions will use Motivational Interviewing&#xD;
      principles to foster openness to NPTs and self-efficacy by helping patients identify their&#xD;
      goals and priorities, understand their NPT options, prepare them to discuss and choose&#xD;
      options with their primary care providers (PCPs), and reinforce these choices to foster&#xD;
      maintenance of these changes. DA contents will be integrated into these sessions, which will&#xD;
      facilitate discussion of these options with their PCP. The first 3 sessions take place prior&#xD;
      to the patient's next scheduled PCP visit; the final session occurs after this visit.&#xD;
      Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 3 months (i.e., after completing the final&#xD;
      coaching session), and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the wait-list control group will receive usual care (in addition to&#xD;
      study assessments at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months). After completing the final&#xD;
      assessment, they will then be given the DA along with a 20-minute coaching session to walk&#xD;
      them through it (patients may decline the coaching session or schedule for a future time).&#xD;
