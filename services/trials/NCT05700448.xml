      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sugemalimab (CS1001) in&#xD;
      combination with PGemOx regimen (pegaspargase, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin) in treatment of&#xD;
      adult patients with Extranodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma (ENKTL) who have relapsed or become&#xD;
      refractory to asparaginase-based regimens.&#xD;
