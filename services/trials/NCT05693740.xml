    <textblock>
      Keratoconus (KC), which was first described in detail in 1854, is the most common corneal&#xD;
      primary ectasia and is characterized by progressive bilateral and asymmetric corneal thinning&#xD;
      and bulging outward into a cone-like shape that can severely impact patients' vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keratoconus usually develops in the second and third decades of life and progresses until the&#xD;
      fourth decade. It was thought to be a rare corneal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a great deal of research, no one theory explains it all and it may be caused by a&#xD;
      combination of things. However, Meek proposed that the loss of structural integrity in the KC&#xD;
      cornea was caused by the presence of abnormal keratocytes and matrix proteins and upregulated&#xD;
      proteolysis triggered an unravelling of lamellae along their length and from their anchors at&#xD;
      the limbus, with an opening of the lamellar bifurcations. This theory is supported by&#xD;
      observations following riboflavin/UVA collagen cross-linking, where the proposed&#xD;
      cross-linkage of the tissue increases both the resistance of the stroma to enzymatic&#xD;
      digestion and the cohesiveness between collagen fibrils and the non-collagenous matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional CXL (CXL) with a continuous irradiation of 3 mW/cm2 for 30 min is considered&#xD;
      safe and effective in the prevention of keratoconus progression according to different&#xD;
      clinical trials. nevertheless, the procedure is time-consuming, lasting around 1 h, which may&#xD;
      lead to patient discomfort and reduced physician working efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With evolving technical advances, commercially available UV light sources have been&#xD;
      developed, making CXL more efficient with shorter UV exposure times, higher UV intensities,&#xD;
      and pulsed light compared with continuous light settings. Various accelerated CXL protocols&#xD;
      have been described and its effect on biomechanical properties on corneas stated as equal to&#xD;
      the standard protocol. Ex-vivo studies also suggest a distinction between various accelerated&#xD;
      CXL protocols by providing evidence for a drop in efficiency with increased UV illumination&#xD;
      intensity while maintaining equal surface energy. In this study we evaluate the two types of&#xD;
      &quot;accelerated crosslinking&quot;.&#xD;
