  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of Acute variceal bleeding includes endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) along with&#xD;
      vasoactive agents. Inspite of successful hemostasis, this is associated with high variceal&#xD;
      rebleeding (VRB) in Child B and C cirrhosis and have higher 6-week mortality rates.&#xD;
      Pre-emptive TIPS has shown to prevent rebleed and improve survival in child B and C patients&#xD;
      but is associated with liver related complications in advanced disease. HVPG guided therapy&#xD;
      and treatment response is known to improve rebleeding and associated with improved survival.&#xD;
      This is based on achieving hemodynamic response defined as HVPG reduction of ≥20% from&#xD;
      baseline or absolute reduction of HVPG &lt;/= 12 mmHg for secondary prophylaxis for prevention&#xD;
      of rebleeding. Studies have shown the safety of giving terlipressin in patients receiving&#xD;
      beta- blockers. We aim to achieve hemodynamic response with addition of carvedilol with&#xD;
      vasoactive agent for reduction of portal blood flow to decreases rebleeding episodes and&#xD;
      reduce mortality.&#xD;

      Aim and Objective To compare the hemodynamic response of early addition of carvedilol with&#xD;
      terlipressin in patients with cirrhosis presenting with acute esophageal variceal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective • To study the hemodynamic response (HVPG reduction of ≥20% from baseline&#xD;
      or absolute reduction of HVPG &lt;/= 12 mmHg) in the groups at 5-days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rebleeding rate in the two groups at 5-days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rebleeding rate at 6-weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction of HVPG &lt;16mm Hg in both groups at 5-days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salvage treatment, TIPS in both groups at 5-days and at 6-weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salvage treatment, SEMS, SB tube placement in-between groups at 5-days and at 6- weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival at 6-weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver related decompensation in-between groups at 6-weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events between the groups at 6-weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with Child's B and C cirrhosis who present with acute esophageal&#xD;
      variceal bleed, between 18-75 years will be enrolled and randomized based on inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design- Prospective open label RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period - 1.5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:Sample size will be calculated assuming that baseline characteristics (22.2±5.0&#xD;
      mmHg) are same and HVPG reduction on 5th day with terlipressin is 19.1±5 mmHg [7] and&#xD;
      estimating a further reduction of 15% with addition of carvedilol [14] (16.3±4.3 mmHg), with&#xD;
      an alpha value equal to 5 % and power of 80%, we need to enrol 45 cases in both arms.&#xD;
      Assuming an attrition rate of 10%, it was decided to enrol 100 cases, 50 in each group,&#xD;
      randomly allocated by block randomization method with block size of 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All patients to receive Inj. Terlipressin, 1 mg at 4 hours along with standard&#xD;
      management for acute variceal bleed as per institutional protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A- Carvedilol will be initiated on day 2, at a dose of 3.125mg twice a day (6.25mg/day),&#xD;
      along with standard management as per institutional protocol for AVB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B- Carvedilol will be initiated on day 6, at a dose of 3.125mg twice a day (6.25mg/day),&#xD;
      along with standard management as per institutional protocol for AVB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Monitoring and assessment: Patients will be admitted in GI-bleed ICU and will be randomized&#xD;
      into the study groups after successful endoscopic control of the bleed. Each patient will be&#xD;
      monitored as per the institutional protocol for management of upper GI bleed. A detailed&#xD;
      clinical history will be taken, and blood investigations and other relevant investigations&#xD;
      required will be done as mentioned in the table 2. Patient will undergo HCC surveillance as&#xD;
      per the guideline. Once discharged, patient will be called for OPD visits and routine&#xD;
      investigations as planned will be done. Patient will be assessed for the tolerance of&#xD;
      carvedilol and dose escalation to a maximum dose of 6.25mg twice a day (12.5mg/day) will be&#xD;
      achieved. Each patient will maintain a &quot;patient diary&quot; for ease in recording details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 2: Investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0-5 Complete physical evaluation Hemogram, Kidney function test, Liver function test, INR&#xD;
      Ultrasound abdomen with spleno-portal axis doppler Fibroscan-liver and spleen Coagulation&#xD;
      parameter, vWF, ADAMTS-13 2D-ECHO, ECG Rest investigation, monitoring, antibiotics as per&#xD;
      hospital protocol HVPG on Day 1 and at Day 5 Planned OPD visits on day 7, 14, 28, 42&#xD;
      Hemogram, Kidney function test, Liver function test, INR Follow-up visits Repeat upper GI&#xD;
      endoscopy every 3 weeks till variceal eradication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HVPG guided treatment and achieving hemodynamic response post bleed will reduce rebleeding&#xD;
      rates and will prevent further decompensation and reduce mortality in patients with Child B&#xD;
      and C cirrhosis.&#xD;
