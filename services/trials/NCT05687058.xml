  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to learn about the safety of empagliflozin in dialysis patients as a&#xD;
      preparation for a future large clinical trial. Empagliflozin has been approved by the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration for the treatment of either type 2 diabetes, heart failure, or&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease among patients not on dialysis. The use of empagliflozin has not been&#xD;
      studied or approved among patients on dialysis for kidney failure because empagliflozin acts&#xD;
      on the kidneys. However, recent experimental studies have indicated that empagliflozin may&#xD;
      provide direct heart benefits. Some dialysis patients have substantial residual kidney&#xD;
      function, which may be protected by empagliflozin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given empagliflozin for three (3) months on top of the standard of care&#xD;
      (usual medical care for participants' condition) and will be followed up until one (1) month&#xD;
      after the last dose. The investigators will collect information about participants' general&#xD;
      health, obtain blood, urine, and imaging studies, check home blood pressure, monitor home&#xD;
      blood sugar levels, and ask health-related questions to assess the safety and potential&#xD;
      benefits of empagliflozin over four (4) months, including one month before the three&#xD;
      (3)-month empagliflozin treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The incidence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in the US ranks among the highest in the&#xD;
      world. ESKD is the last phase of chronic kidney disease when the kidneys are functioning&#xD;
      below 10-15% of normal capacity, and the patient is on dialysis. According to the US Renal&#xD;
      Data System (USRDS), 120,834 individuals started dialysis and nearly 524,000 people were&#xD;
      living on dialysis in 2017.1 Although advancement in technology and general medical care has&#xD;
      led to a modest decrease in mortality among dialysis patients, their mortality rate remains&#xD;
      extremely high at approximately 16.5 per 100 patient-years. The leading cause of death among&#xD;
      dialysis patients is cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for almost 45% of deaths.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, established therapies to prevent incident CVD in the general population, such&#xD;
      as renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or statins, have not been shown to be effective in the&#xD;
      dialysis population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium-glucose transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are originally approved by FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment for type 2 diabetes. SGLT2 is localized to the brush border of the early proximal&#xD;
      tubule, and hence, SGLT2inhibitors induce osmotic diuresis and natriuresis but do not&#xD;
      activate the systemic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.2 Recent clinical trials have&#xD;
      consistently shown their potent renal and cardiovascular benefits in both diabetic and&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients, which cannot be explained only by their glucose-lowering and diuretic&#xD;
      properties. In fact, diuretics have not been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality and&#xD;
      such benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are clear even among non-diabetic populations.3-5 Their&#xD;
      renoprotective effect potentially extends to the dialysis population where residual kidney&#xD;
      function (RKF) still plays a major role in solute clearance and volume control and has a&#xD;
      strong association with patient outcomes.6 Patients who retain greater RKF can consume a more&#xD;
      liberal diet and have better nutritional status, less pill burden, better blood pressure, and&#xD;
      less interdialytic fluid gain with less frequent intradialytic hypotension, as well as&#xD;
      greater quality of life and better survival.6 The pathophysiology underlying the&#xD;
      cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are yet to be fully elucidated, but a recent&#xD;
      in-vitro studies indicate its direct effects on cardiomyocytes. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that dialysis patients also benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors even if they do not&#xD;
      have any RKF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy and safety studies with SGLT2 inhibitors did not enroll end-stage kidney disease&#xD;
      (ESKD) patients on dialysis. Empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin can be started&#xD;
      if the glomerular filtration rate is more than 20-25 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and can be continued&#xD;
      until dialysis initiation or kidney transplant. From a pharmacokinetics standpoint, those&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibitors are extensively metabolized by glucuronidation into inactive metabolites,&#xD;
      and are not likely to cause dose-dependent toxicity even in ESKD. Nevertheless, extra caution&#xD;
      is necessary for their use in the setting of ESKD because SGLT2 inhibitors are not well&#xD;
      dialyzable due to large distribution volumes and high protein binding rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overall goal is to conduct a non-randomized feasibility clinical trial of empagliflozin&#xD;
      in the dialysis population to obtain data that will help plan future larger, sufficiently&#xD;
      powered efficacy clinical trials. The investigators plan to enroll a total of 24 dialysis&#xD;
      patients (18 patients on hemodialysis and 6 patients on peritoneal dialysis). After one month&#xD;
      of the run-in period, participants will take oral empagliflozin for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Hemodialysis is a form of renal replacement therapy that utilizes an external filter&#xD;
      (dialyzer) to remove wastes from the bloodstream. Peritoneal dialysis utilizes the peritoneum&#xD;
      as a filter to remove wastes.&#xD;
