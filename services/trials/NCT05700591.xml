  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous thrombolysis is the first-line therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      within 4·5 hours of symptom onset, and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase)&#xD;
      is the preferred thrombolytic agent for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RhPro-UK is a specific plasminogen activator. rhPro-UK only acts on occlusive thrombus and&#xD;
      has little effect on hemostatic thrombus. In addition, rhPro-UK does not form covalent&#xD;
      complexes with protease inhibitors in plasma, so the concentrations of rhpro-UK and protease&#xD;
      inhibitors in the blood do not decrease compared with alteplase. Therefore, rhPro-UK&#xD;
      therapies have a potential advantage of less systemic bleeding in treated subjects. Data from&#xD;
      several previous studies suggest that rhPro-UK is efficacious when used to treat patients&#xD;
      with acute myocardial infarction. On April 2, 2011, rhPro-UK injection was approved by the&#xD;
      National Medical Products Administration to treat acute myocardial infarction. Since then,&#xD;
      rhPro-UK has been widely used to treat myocardial infarction in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2016, a phase 2 clinical trial was carried to explore the dosing of rhPro-UK in&#xD;
      patients with acute ischemic stroke, followed by another study with a sample size of 680&#xD;
      patients to initially validate the efficacy and safety of the proposed dose of 35mg. The&#xD;
      results of these studies suggested that rhPro-UK was effective, and there were no safety&#xD;
      concerns. To further prove the efficacy and safety of rhPro-UK in patients with acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, investigators conducted this phase 3 study (PROST-2).&#xD;
