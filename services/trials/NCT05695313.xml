  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study recommends the use of OnLife dietary supplement, which will be followed by a few&#xD;
      day before the initiation of PACLITAXEL, for the prevention of PACLITAXEL induced neuropathy.&#xD;
      OnLife will be continued one month after stopping chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This would limit the number of PACLITAXEL dose reductions and premature interruptions of this&#xD;
      chemotherapy, thus potentially improving the results in terms of antitumor efficacy, while&#xD;
      improving the quality of life of patients treated with weekly PACLITAXEL.&#xD;
