  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown in previous studies that burst suppression has an effect on the development&#xD;
      of postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). With the&#xD;
      development of technology, EEG-based anesthesia management is getting more and more&#xD;
      attention. In particular, methods that reduce anesthetic drug consumption are expected to&#xD;
      prevent POD and POCD by reducing burst suppression. There are studies that show that epidural&#xD;
      analgesia applications reduce general anesthesia drug consumption in patients receiving&#xD;
      general anesthesia. In this study, investigators want to investigate the effect of epidural&#xD;
      analgesia combined with general anesthesia on burst suppression. POD and POCD development in&#xD;
      these patients will be examined as secondary objectives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium (POD) is an acute cognitive disorder characterized by inattention,&#xD;
      disorganized thinking, and a fluctuating course that develops over hours or days. Although&#xD;
      delirium depends on the type of surgery, it is a common postoperative complication with an&#xD;
      incidence of 10%-70%. POD causes an increase in mortality, morbidity and health care costs.&#xD;
      Risk factors for POD; age, type and duration of surgery, inadequate pain control, type of&#xD;
      anesthesia, anemia, transfusion, and preoperative cognitive impairment. In recent years, it&#xD;
      has been emphasized that POD can be reduced with the widespread use of electroencephalogram&#xD;
      (EEG) based anesthesia management and optimization of anesthetic drugs according to EEG&#xD;
      patterns. EEG consists of 6 waveforms: slow, delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma. Behavioral&#xD;
      and neurophysiological patterns caused by anesthetic drugs are associated with different&#xD;
      electroencephalogram waveforms. Recent developments in the introduction of EEG-based monitors&#xD;
      have made significant contributions to the understanding of the fundamental changes in brain&#xD;
      activity caused by anesthetic agents. Today, there are EEG-based anesthesia depth monitors&#xD;
      such as bispectral index (BIS) (Medtronic, USA) or Sedline (Masimo Irvine CA). These monitors&#xD;
      make it easier to optimize the depth of anesthesia with the numerical data obtained as a&#xD;
      result of some calculations as well as the raw EEG. The burst suppression (BS) pattern on the&#xD;
      EEG shows a decrease in brain neuronal activity and metabolic activity. Burst suppression can&#xD;
      be induced by anesthetic drugs that modulate Î³-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. Although&#xD;
      sometimes deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes to treat refractory status&#xD;
      epilepticus or increased intracranial pressure, burst suppression is generally considered&#xD;
      potentially harmful and should be avoided.Studies conducted in recent years have shown the&#xD;
      relationship between intraoperative burst suppression (BS) and POD. POD; It can be reduced by&#xD;
      continuous EEG monitoring, reducing the dose of propofol, preferring regional anesthesia,&#xD;
      effective postoperative pain control, early mobilization, and early postoperative discharge.&#xD;
      Interventions that can reduce the development of postoperative delirium will be important for&#xD;
      public health. Epidural analgesia can be used effectively in perioperative analgesia. It has&#xD;
      been reported in the literature that epidural analgesia combined with general anesthesia&#xD;
      reduces the amount of hypnotic drug required to achieve similar depth of anesthesia compared&#xD;
      to general anesthesia alone. There is no study in the literature on whether the combination&#xD;
      of epidural analgesia and general anesthesia reduces BS in EEG-based anesthesia applications.&#xD;
      Our primary aim in this study is to evaluate whether the combination of general anesthesia&#xD;
      and epidural analgesia reduces BS in EEG-based anesthesia in patients undergoing total hip&#xD;
      and knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
