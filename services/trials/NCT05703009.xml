  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SSDXA-14 is a Phase 2 (feasibility/pilot) double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sacrosidase and placebo in 25 subjects objectively&#xD;
      diagnosed with fructan intolerance.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of sacrosidase and placebo in male&#xD;
      and female subjects aged 18 years or older objectively diagnosed with fructan intolerance via&#xD;
      fructan breath test within 2 years prior to informed consent and are negative for&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease or low-grade GI bacterial infection, detected by fecal&#xD;
      calprotectin test, celiac disease, detected by serology for anti-gluten protein antibodies,&#xD;
      congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID), detected by sucrose hydrogen-methane breath&#xD;
      test, and have a negative result for abnormal uncontrolled thyroid function, detected by the&#xD;
      standard TSH blood test. This study will consist of a Screening Visit, Baseline Period,&#xD;
      Treatment Period 1, Washout Period, and Treatment Period 2. Subjects will be required to&#xD;
      attend 5 clinic visits during study participation. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      fashion to either receive sacrosidase or placebo during Treatment Period 1. Following a 7-day&#xD;
      Washout Period, subjects will receive their crossover study medication for Treatment Period&#xD;
      2. Subjects will take their assigned study medication for 7 days during each Treatment&#xD;
      Period.&#xD;
