      A Prospective, Non-Randomized, Multi-Center Observational Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and effectiveness of InnovaMatrix AC porcine placental ECM therapy&#xD;
      for the treatment of chronic, non-healing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be treated with a weekly application of sterilized, porcine placental&#xD;
      ECM followed by standard of care wound therapy and offloading&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center observational study . The trial will include 30 completed&#xD;
      subjects at three (3) experienced clinical centers in the United States. The estimated&#xD;
      enrollment period is 13 weeks. After completing a screening , the subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      and receive treatment followed for at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the majority of the subjects will be recruited from patients being seen&#xD;
      in the Investigators' practices. No minors will be included in the study and it is&#xD;
      anticipated that there will be a roughly equal representation of male and female subjects.&#xD;
      Further, no subjects will be excluded because of race or ethnicity and all efforts will be&#xD;
      made to adequately represent the study population in the area in which they are chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be used for the analysis of efficacy and safety data.&#xD;
