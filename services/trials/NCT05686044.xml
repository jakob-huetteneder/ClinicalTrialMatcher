  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure efficacy and safety of three different doses of&#xD;
      buntanetap compared with placebo in participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study details include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The double-blind treatment duration will include a screening period of up to 42 days followed&#xD;
      by 12 weeks of treatment at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be 4-5 months. There will be 4 in-clinic visits and 1 phone call.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      320 mild to moderate AD participants will be randomized to 7.5 mg, 15 mg, 30mg of buntanetap&#xD;
      QD or placebo. If they provide informed consent, they will undergo a Screening Visit, and if&#xD;
      they are considered eligible per the inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will proceed to&#xD;
      participate in the treatment period. Randomized participants will visit the clinic for the&#xD;
      first-time dosing in clinic, followed by an at home dosing period of 12 weeks, with daily&#xD;
      administration of 7.5 mg, 15 mg or 30 mg of buntanetap or placebo. Participants will be&#xD;
      required to visit clinics Day 0 (baseline), 6 weeks, and 12 weeks (end-of-trial), where they&#xD;
      will undergo study procedures that include safety assessments (AE and concomitant medication&#xD;
      monitoring, 12-lead ECGs, clinical laboratory testing, vital signs assessments, and physical&#xD;
      examinations) and psychometric tests (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale&#xD;
      11 (ADAS-Cog11), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change&#xD;
      (ADCS-CGIC), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living&#xD;
      Scale (ADCS-ADL), Digital Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Mini Mental State Examination&#xD;
      (MMSE)). At the end of blood sampling, the participants will need to stay for a minimum of 1&#xD;
      hour of observation. After all end-of-study procedures are complete, the subject will be&#xD;
      discharged to home. A 24-hour follow-up call will occur after all clinical visits to assess&#xD;
      the participants current condition and if there are any additional adverse events or&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a 12-weeks, placebo-controlled and double-blind trial: participants,&#xD;
      investigators and the sponsor will be blinded to the participants' treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualified participants will be randomly assigned at a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the four&#xD;
      treatment arms: buntanetap 7.5 mg, buntanetap 15 mg, buntanetap 30mg, and placebo, through an&#xD;
      Interactive Randomization System, after a screening period of up to 42 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADAS-Cog 11, ADCS-CGIC, ADCS-ADL, DSST, and MMSE will be assessed by clinicians who have&#xD;
      successfully completed the requisite certifications/trainings for each assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One interim analysis is planned. It will take place when 90 enrolled subjects (~30%) have&#xD;
      completed the Week 6 assessments to re-assess the sample size. No interim analyses are&#xD;
      planned for the purpose of stopping the study early for futility.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of treatment period (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 11 (ADAS-Cog 11) measures cognitive functions and non-cognitive functions such as mood and behavior. It was designed to measure the cognitive and behavioral domains known to be affected in Alzheimer disease, including memory, language, orientation, construction, and planning of simple designs, and completed simple goal-oriented behaviors.&#xD;
Specifically, the ADAS-Cog comprises ratings from 11 components: word recall, word recognition, constructional praxis, orientation, naming objects and fingers, commands, ideational praxis, remembering test instructions, spoken language, word finding, and comprehension.&#xD;
Total scores range from 0-70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment.</description>

    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12 clinic visits (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC) focuses on clinicians' observations of change in the patient's cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance since the beginning of a trial. It relies on both direct examination of the patient and interview of informants.&#xD;
The ADCS-CGIC measures whether the effects of active treatment are substantial enough to be detected by a skilled and experienced clinician on the basis of a clinical interview and examination. It relies on both direct examination of the patient and an interview of the study partner.&#xD;
A skilled and experienced clinician who is blinded to treatment assignment rates the patient on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening). Lower scores indicate better improvement.</description>

    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of treatment period (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL) is a 23-item inventory scale developed as a rater-administered questionnaire answered by the participant's study partner.&#xD;
The ADCS-ADL measures 6 basic activities of daily living (BADL) items and 17 instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) items that provide a total score from 0-78, with a lower score indicating greater severity. Basic activities include basic self-care tasks such as feeding, mobility, toileting, bathing, grooming and dressing. Instrumental activities are more complex and vary based on cultural norms, gender roles. As such, instrumental activities tend to include a broad range of activities.&#xD;
Caregivers are asked to rate the degree to which their family member or loved one can perform a variety of tasks. The assessed activities provide a total score from 0-78. Participants with a lower score indicates greater severity.</description>

    <description>The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score is a brief screening instrument used to assess cognitive function (orientation, memory, attention, ability to name objects, follow verbal/written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures).&#xD;
Total score ranges from 0 to 30 with a lower score indicating greater disease severity.</description>
