    <textblock>
      Candonilimab（AK104）is a humanized IgG1 bispecific antibody that targets PD-1 and CTLA-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label, phase II study, the purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of candonilimab plus radiotherapy in participants with&#xD;
      locally advanced cervical cancer who do not tolerate chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to approximately 40 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire that rates the overall quality of life in cancer participants. The first 28 questions use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) for evaluating function (physical, role, social, cognitive, emotional), symptoms (diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and pain) and financial difficulties. The last 2 questions use a 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent) to evaluate overall health and quality of life. Global scores are converted to a score of 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating improved health status. The change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 score will be presented.</description>

    <description>Participants receive candonilimab at a dose of 10 mg/kg, Q3W (Day 1 of each 21 day treatment cycle) via IV infusion, until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, investigator determines that the participant cannot continue to benefit, withdraws informed consent, or candonilimab treatment over 2 years. During the q3w dosing period of candonilimab, participants receive radiotherapy including external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and followed by brachytherapy.</description>
