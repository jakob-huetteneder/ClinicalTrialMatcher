      DIAMOND study is a national, multicentre, randomized, parallel-group, open label study in&#xD;
      patients (aged ≥18 years) with mechanical aortic valve at least 7 days after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated with apixaban 5 mg twice daily (BID)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Comparator group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated with warfarin with an objective of INR target of 2.5 (range: 2.0-3.0)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary objective is To demonstrate that antithrombotic treatment with apixaban is&#xD;
      non-inferior to warfarin (INR target range 2.0 - 3.0) in patients with mechanical heart valve&#xD;
      implanted in the aortic position for at least 7 days for the primary net clinical benefit&#xD;
      endpoint of ischemic outcomes (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolism and&#xD;
      valve thrombosis) and bleeding (ISTH major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antithrombotic management of patients with mechanical heart valves continues to be an&#xD;
      important medical concern. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are currently the only oral&#xD;
      anticoagulants approved for mechanical prosthetic valve-implanted patients. As effective as&#xD;
      these anticoagulants are, they have major drawbacks: narrow therapeutic window, variable&#xD;
      dose-response in individuals, interaction with several foods and drugs. Achieved INR is&#xD;
      frequently outside the target range and INR instability is a predictor of bleeding and late&#xD;
      mortality in patients with mechanical heart valve prosthesis. Despite multiple studies that&#xD;
      show that tissue valves have a limited durability, many patients sometimes even young choose&#xD;
      this type of valve to avoid VKAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In randomized studies and registries, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have demonstrated&#xD;
      their superiority to reduce bleeding in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      compared to VKAs with similar efficacy and are recommended as first choice in the guidelines.&#xD;
      Apixaban has demonstrated a favorable benefit-risk profile to reduce bleeding in the&#xD;
      different indications (ranging from 25-50%). So far, DOACs are currently contra-indicated or&#xD;
      not indicated in patients with a mechanical prosthesis. The results of a single small-sized&#xD;
      phase II randomized trial testing an anti-IIa drug were disappointing and anti-Xa drugs have&#xD;
      not been appropriately evaluated in patients with a mechanical prosthesis. Only small&#xD;
      observational series suggest encouraging results with anti-Xa DOACs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ongoing randomized trials are conducted with DOACs compared to warfarin but the studies only&#xD;
      include one type of mechanical aortic valve or mechanical valve in mitral position. Moreover,&#xD;
      these studies are underpowered to completely answer the question about clinical ischemic and&#xD;
      bleeding outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, there is an unmet clinical need for an alternative to VKAs, such as an anti-Xa DOAC&#xD;
      like apixaban, as anticoagulation in patients with a mechanical aortic prosthetic valve. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine if patients with mechanical prosthetic valve in the&#xD;
      aortic position at least 7 days after cardiac surgery can be maintained effectively with a&#xD;
      better safety (net clinical benefit) on apixaban compared to warfarin.&#xD;
