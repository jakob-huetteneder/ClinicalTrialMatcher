    <textblock>
      Despite overwhelming evidence for neurocognitive and neurophysiological factors involved in&#xD;
      the etiology of psychosis, these factors have never been examined as mechanisms of&#xD;
      improvement from CBTp. The first aim in the present study is to examine neurophysiological&#xD;
      outcomes from CBTp using electroencephalography (EEG). The second aim is to examine&#xD;
      neurocognitive outcomes from CBTp. This is an open-label pilot study. Twenty participants&#xD;
      will receive CBTp and will be assessed at baseline and after 4 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite decades of refining traditional treatments for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders,&#xD;
      recovery rates remain unchanged at only 13.5%, and there is an urgent need for innovative new&#xD;
      interventions. Cognitive behavioural therapy has more recently been applied to treating&#xD;
      psychosis and initial evidence has suggested that cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis&#xD;
      (CBTp) is the most effective psychosocial intervention available for psychosis. However, the&#xD;
      efficacy of CBTp has been limited to moderate effect sizes. Little is currently understood&#xD;
      about the mechanisms of CBTp, and a greater understanding of mechanisms is necessary in order&#xD;
      to improve treatment efficacy. Despite overwhelming evidence for neurocognitive and&#xD;
      neurophysiological factors involved in the etiology of psychosis, these factors have never&#xD;
      been examined as mechanisms of improvement from CBTp. Cognitive behavioural therapy for&#xD;
      psychosis (CBTp) has demonstrated efficacy for reducing positive symptoms, negative symptoms,&#xD;
      and improving community functioning6 for individuals diagnosed with psychotic disorders.&#xD;
      Despite meta-analytic evidence for the efficacy of CBTp, little is known about the&#xD;
      neurophysiological processes through which symptomatic and functional change occurs.&#xD;
      Electroencephalography (EEG) provides temporally precise measurement of neurophysiological&#xD;
      activity. Positive symptoms have been associated with reduced integration of discrepant&#xD;
      information as indexed by the N400 event-related potential, reduced resting state power in&#xD;
      the EEG alpha frequency band, and reduced cognitive control as indexed by EEG alpha and theta&#xD;
      power during cognitive flanker tasks. Additionally, neurocognitive abilities such as&#xD;
      attention, memory, and problem solving are the best predictors of community functioning among&#xD;
      individuals diagnosed with psychotic disorders. Although CBTp improves community&#xD;
      functioning,[6] neurophysiological and neurocognitive outcomes have never been examined as&#xD;
      therapeutic mechanisms from CBTp, despite the fact that therapeutic processes would be&#xD;
      expected to improve cognitive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Examine neurophysiological outcomes from CBTp using EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine neurocognitive outcomes from CBTp&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: After CBTp it is expected that participants will have a) increased N400&#xD;
      amplitude; b) increased resting state EEG alpha power; and c) reduced alpha and increased&#xD;
      theta power during a flanker task&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: After CBTp participants will have increased global neurocognitive abilities as&#xD;
      indexed by a neurocognitive composite score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although CBTp has demonstrated efficacy to improve symptoms for individuals experiencing&#xD;
      psychosis, little is known about the neurophysiological process through which this&#xD;
      improvement occurs, and neither EEG nor neurocognitive outcomes from CBTp have ever been&#xD;
      examined. The current results will provide preliminary evidence for neurophysiological&#xD;
      mechanisms of change from CBTp that will increase understanding of the disorder and provide&#xD;
      critical insights for refining psychotherapeutic interventions. Additionally, psychotherapy&#xD;
      trials typically only examine psychological outcomes, however, if CBTp is effective it would&#xD;
      be expected that this could be detected at both the neurophysiological level and&#xD;
      neurocognitive level as well. My incorporation of multiple levels of assessment in clinical&#xD;
      trials was recently praised as a goldstandard approach to trial methodology. This line of&#xD;
      research is critical to improving the efficacy of CBTp.&#xD;
