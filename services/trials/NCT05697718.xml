    <textblock>
      MSCs are a type of stem cells derived from mesoderm with multidirectional differentiation&#xD;
      potential. Studies have shown that MSCs have the potential to differentiate not only to bone,&#xD;
      cartilage, fat and myogenic cells, but also to neurons.Among them, human cord blood&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells are a kind of mature mesenchymal stem cells currently used. Human cord&#xD;
      blood mesenchymal stem cells are ideal seed cells for tissue engineering. In addition to the&#xD;
      advantages of convenient acquisition, rich source, easy expansion, etc., human cord blood&#xD;
      collection also has the following advantages: (1) Collection of cord blood has no harm to&#xD;
      maternal and newborn;(2) The cells are more primitive and have stronger ability of&#xD;
      proliferation and differentiation;(3) Low immunogenicity, strong tolerance to human leukocyte&#xD;
      antigen and low incidence of rejection;(4) The infection and transmission probability of&#xD;
      tumor cells, viruses and pathogenic microorganisms is relatively low;(5) It does not involve&#xD;
      many controversies in social, ethical and legal aspects.Current studies believe that the&#xD;
      possible mechanisms of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of stroke&#xD;
      include replacing damaged nerve cells, promoting the proliferation and differentiation of&#xD;
      endogenous nerve cells, secreting neurotrophic factors, promoting angiogenesis, reducing&#xD;
      nerve cell apoptosis, and inhibiting inflammation.&#xD;
