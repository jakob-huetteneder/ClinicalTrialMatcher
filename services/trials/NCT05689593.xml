  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy(eswt)&#xD;
      applied in addition to conventional physical therapy on pain, mobility, functional ability,&#xD;
      sleep quality and activities of daily living in patients with adhesive capsulitis compared to&#xD;
      low-level laser therapy and to investigate whether they are superior to the control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 60 adhesive capsulitis with age range 18-65 who applied to KÄ±rsehir Ahi Evran&#xD;
      University Training and Research Hospital were examined.Adhesive capsulitis is also called&#xD;
      arthrofibrosis, which involves excessive adhesion formation along the glenohumeral joint. It&#xD;
      is a disease of unknown etiology and is classified as primary and secondary. Primary adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis includes cases of idiopathic origin resulting from chronic inflammation with&#xD;
      fibroblast proliferation. Secondary adhesive capsulitis, central nervous system involvement,&#xD;
      arm immobilized for a long time, trauma or fracture, infectious diseases, etc. Includes&#xD;
      post-mortem situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adhesive capsulitis progression is characterized by four stages, each stage presenting a&#xD;
      distinctive clinical picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      low-level laser therapy supports cell proliferation and tissue regeneration with its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and photobiostimulation properties.The pressure waves of ESWT pass through&#xD;
      fluids and soft tissues and exert their effects in areas of impedance change such as bones&#xD;
      and soft tissue spaces. These waves have mechanical and cellular effects. The most important&#xD;
      of these effects are temporary damage to the neuronal cell membrane or increased&#xD;
      permeability. These mechanisms may facilitate neovascularization and cellular regeneration in&#xD;
      tissues.&#xD;

    <time_frame>0. week</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. It is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.Pain intensity was measured with visual analogue scale for pain (0-10 mm; 0 means no pain, 10 means severe pain) which is used to measure musculoskeletal pain with very good reliability and validity</description>

    <time_frame>0. week</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant-Murley score (CMS) is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters. These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient. The Constant-Murley score was introduced to determine the functionality after the treatment of a shoulder injury. The test is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), strength (25 points) and range of motion: forward elevation, external rotation, abduction and internal rotation of the shoulder (40 points). The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>

    <description>This scale was developed by Busse et al. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) assesses sleep quality and disorder and consists of seven subcomponents (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, drug use, and daytime functions) and 19 items. Each component is evaluated on a score of 0-3 and is evaluated with a total sleep score ranging from 0 to 21, and high scores represent low sleep quality. A PSQI total score &lt; 5 points is considered &quot;good&quot; sleep quality and &gt; 5 points is &quot;bad&quot; sleep quality.</description>

    <description>This scale was developed to assess the quality of life associated with general health status and its Turkish validity and reliability was made by KoÃ§yiÄit et al. The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) measures the health domains of physical functioning, physical role, body pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional role, and mental health. The subscales evaluate health between 0 and 100 scores. The higher the score indicates better health status. In this study, physical health score was calculated by means of physical function, physical role limitation, pain, and general health subscales. Mental health score was calculated by averaging the energy/vitality, social function, emotional role limitation, and mental health subscales</description>
