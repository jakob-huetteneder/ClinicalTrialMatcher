  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Tislelizumab in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      (prior to surgery) or adjuvant (after surgery) treatment of previously untreated adults with&#xD;
      gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypotheses are that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant and adjuvant Tislelizumab plus chemoradiotherapy, followed by adjuvant&#xD;
      Tislelizumab and chemotherapy is superior to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy,&#xD;
      followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of rate of Pathological Complete Response (pathCR)&#xD;
      at the time of surgery.&#xD;

    <description>PathCR rate is defined as the percentage of participants having a pathCR. pathCR is defined as no invasive disease within an entirely submitted and evaluated gross lesion, and histologically negative nodes.</description>

    <measure>Event-free Survival (EFS) Per Response Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>EFS is based on RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator and is defined as the time from randomization to the first of the following events: radiographic disease progression per RECIST 1.1; local or distant recurrence as assessed by CT scan or biopsy if indicated (for participants who are disease free after surgery); clinical progression as evidenced by peritoneal carcinomatosis confirmed by preoperative laparoscopy or laparotomy (for participants who are confirmed to be free of peritoneal involvement by laparoscopy at screening); or death due to any cause. A second primary malignancy, or radiographic progressive disease (PD) during the neoadjuvant phase that does not preclude successful surgery (i.e., disease free after surgery), are not considered EFS events.</description>
