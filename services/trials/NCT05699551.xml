  <brief_summary>

      In this study, the efficacy of exercise to improve interstitial cystitis/bladder pain&#xD;
      syndrome symptoms and quality of life will be investigated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective treatment for symptoms associated with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome&#xD;
      is a significant clinical challenge problem due to the lack of insight into disease&#xD;
      etiology/pathophysiology, costly and potentially invasive procedures, and a lack of research&#xD;
      into potential therapeutics. The primary objective is to determine if a supervised exercise&#xD;
      program by a trained exercise physiologist can relieve pain and improve urinary and bladder&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. This has the potential&#xD;
      to open enormous future avenues of research, save both patients and the healthcare system&#xD;
      cost, and most importantly improve patients' lives. A second objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if exercise alters depressive symptoms, often a comorbid diagnosis, in patients&#xD;
      with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. A third objective of this study is to&#xD;
      examine urinary markers of inflammation before and after exercise in patients with&#xD;
      interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, month 2, month 4</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a questionnaire that consists of 8 subsections of 36 total questions. The sections are Physical functioning (10 items), Role limitations due to physical health (4 items), Role limitations due to emotional problems (4 items), Energy/fatigue (4 items), Emotional well-being (5 items), Social functioning (2 items), Pain (2 items), General health (5 items). Aggregate scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, compiled as a percentage - where the higher the score, the more favorable the health state of the patient.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS-31) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, month 2, month 4</time_frame>
    <description>The test has 6 domains looking at autonomic symptoms: orthostatic intolerance, vasomotor, secretomotor, gastrointestinal, bladder and pupillomotor. The six domain scores sum to a total COMPASS 31 score of 0 to 100, and a higher COMPASS 31 score indicates more severe autonomic symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in inflammatory urinary biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Urine samples will be obtained at baseline and at the end of the 4 month exercise period from participants. The urine will then be analyzed for biomarkers of inflammation using a Luminex High Performance Assay. Any decrease in the levels of biomarkers of inflammation in the urine is the outcome of interest.</description>

    <measure>Post-regimen review</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>After the exercise program concludes, participants will be contacted via phone or email and asked to comment on the program and make suggestions for improvement. This will include things such as if they would recommend the program to friends/family, if they have continued to exercise and/or will continue to exercise on their own time, and any portions of the program they would change or do differently.</description>

    <description>Exercise will take place Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 12:00-1:00 pm for 4 months. Every participant will be screened for Coronavirus-19 prior to each exercise session. Aerobic exercise will consist of walking, beginning with a 10-minute duration, with gradual progression to 20 minutes. Muscle strength and endurance and range-of-motion exercise will then be performed. Muscle strength and endurance training will begin using no weight and performing one set of 6 repetitions. Progression using added resistance in the form of dumbbell weights (1-6 lbs.) and increased sets and repetitions will be applied as Subjects become increasingly fit. For static range of motion exercise, positions will be held for 10-15 seconds in the beginning and increased over time. Exercise will be kept at a moderate level of intensity. Each session will then end with relaxation training.</description>
