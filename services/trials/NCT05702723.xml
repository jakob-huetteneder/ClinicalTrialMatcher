  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research study is to assess the feasibility and participants'&#xD;
      satisfaction of the Stress Management and Resiliency - Relaxation Response Resiliency Program&#xD;
      (SMART-3RP) and compare this treatment with SMART-3RP versus referral to a group-based,&#xD;
      online support group to see which is better for improving resilience and decreasing distress&#xD;
      of participants with cancer and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the study intervention involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smart-3RP (virtual, mind-body group treatment program).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot, randomized controlled trial assesses the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy&#xD;
      of the Stress Management and Resiliency - Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (SMART-3RP)&#xD;
      for improving resiliency and decreasing distress among caregivers and cancer survivors&#xD;
      compared to enhanced usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned into one of the study groups: Smart-3RP versus&#xD;
      referral to a group-based, online support group. Randomization means that a participant is&#xD;
      placed into a group by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study is expected to last about 180 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected about 96 people made up of 48 patients and 48 caregivers will take part in&#xD;
      this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is supporting this research by providing funding.&#xD;
