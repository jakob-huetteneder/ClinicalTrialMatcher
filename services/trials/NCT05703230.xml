    <textblock>
      The current multicenter stepped wedge randomized cluster trial study aims to assess whether&#xD;
      implementation of preoperative multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussions is (cost)effective&#xD;
      for high risk noncardiac surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary question: Does implementation of preoperative multidisciplinary team discussions&#xD;
           for high risk noncardiac surgical patients diminish serious adverse events as compared&#xD;
           to care as usual at six months postoperatively or six months after multidisciplinary&#xD;
           team discussion in case of nonsurgical treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary questions: Does implementation of preoperative multidisciplinary team&#xD;
           discussion for high risk noncardiac surgical patients improve disability, survival,&#xD;
           functional outcome, quality of life and cost-effectiveness as compared to care as usual&#xD;
           at six months postoperatively or six months after multidisciplinary team discussion in&#xD;
           case of nonsurgical treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to answer questionnaires at baseline, 3, 6,9 and 12 months&#xD;
      postoperatively or post MDT discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients for whom no structured preoperative multidisciplinary discussion is installed yet&#xD;
      (care as usual) will be compared with patients for whom a structured preoperative&#xD;
      multidisciplinary discussion is performed (intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in hospitals that have no established preoperative MDT meeting at&#xD;
      the start of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the increase in life expectancy and improved care for patients suffering from a&#xD;
      chronic disease, the number of complex patients requiring a surgical intervention is&#xD;
      increasing. It is important to balance the potential benefits of this surgical treatment&#xD;
      against the risk of permanent loss of functional capacity and quality of life due to&#xD;
      complications. European and US guidelines on perioperative care all recommend preoperative&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team meetings for high-risk noncardiac surgical patients. However, the&#xD;
      evidence underlying a benefit of a preoperative MDT meeting is absent and recommendations are&#xD;
      based on expert opinion. Moreover, considerable practice variation is currently present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the efficacy of implementation of a preoperative structured&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team (sMDT) meeting to optimize perioperative management for high risk&#xD;
      noncardiac surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that implementation of preoperative sMDT meetings for high risk noncardiac&#xD;
      surgical patients results in less serious adverse events, is more cost-effective, and&#xD;
      improves quality of life and functional outcome at six months, compared to preoperative care&#xD;
      as usual (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preoperative structured Multidisciplinary Team (sMDT) meeting for high risk noncardiac&#xD;
      surgical patients will be implemented in each participating center (n=14) throughout the&#xD;
      study. In the sMDT meeting, patients' treatment plan and alternatives will be discussed by&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist, surgical specialist and other relevant consultants or (specialized)&#xD;
      nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is Serious adverse events (SAEs) according to the Clavien Dindo&#xD;
      classification grade 3 or more, at 6 months following surgery or following the preoperative&#xD;
      sMDT meeting in case of nonsurgical management. Secondary outcomes are: functional outcome&#xD;
      (12-item WHO Disability Assessment Schedule), survival, quality of life (WHOQOL BREF),&#xD;
      patients' regret (including interview at 6 months), societal costs (iMCQ and iPCQ, Electronic&#xD;
      Medical Record (EMR) data, EQ5D-5L), alterations in perioperative management and sMDT&#xD;
      performance (MDT-MOT), and facilitators and barriers (using structured interviews health care&#xD;
      professionals). Most secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 30 days, 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses will take place for e.g. age groups (approximate quintiles), patient sex,&#xD;
      size of hospital, intent of surgery, BMI categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese,&#xD;
      â‰¥super obese), ASA physical status, frailty, MET score, smoking behavior, alcohol use,&#xD;
      comorbidity index score, planned postoperative destination, educational attainment, and&#xD;
      employment status.&#xD;

    <measure>Regret of decision</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients regret of decision measured by a modification of the Decision Regret Scale at 3, 6 and 12 months and qualitative interviews with several patients at 6 months.&#xD;
The decision regret scale is a 5-item questionnaire, scoring statements 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). Final scoring consists of reversing the scores of the two negatively phrased items, then taking the mean of the five items. Last, the mean is converted to a score ranging from 0 to 100 by subtracting 1 and multiplying by 25. A higher score may indicate greater patient regret about their made treatment decisions. The scale was modified by adding a question asking by whom the decision was made. This question is not part of the previously described scoring of the 5-item decision regret scale.</description>

A score of '5' represents optimal effectiveness, calibrated against recommendations within 'The Characteristics of an Effective MDT' (by the National Cancer Action Team). A score of '3' represents effectiveness that exhibits some degree of agreement with the optimum, but not consistently, and a score of '1' represents no or little agreement with the defined optimum. Scores of '2' and '4' are included in the tool but not defined to allow observers the freedom to gradate their assessment.</description>
