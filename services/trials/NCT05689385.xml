  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the effect of eHealth-based&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation with the effect of usual care on exercise capacity and qualify of life&#xD;
      in patients after myocardial infarction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation can improve exercise capacity, life of quality, readmission rate and&#xD;
      mortality rate for patients after myocardial infarction. International guidelines list&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction as class IA recommendation. However, low&#xD;
      participation rate of cardiac rehabilitation due to barriers such as lacking of time,&#xD;
      transport or affordability issues is an unsolved problem worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      eHealth, consisting of telemedicine, mobile health and personalized care using wearable&#xD;
      devices has the potential to remove the barriers and become an effective model to deliver&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation. Thus, we design a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect&#xD;
      of a case manager-led eHealth-based cardiac rehabilitation program with usual care on the&#xD;
      compliance, physical activity, quality of life, and cardiorespiratory fitness in patients&#xD;
      after myocardial infarction.&#xD;

    <description>The 12-wk case manager-led eHCR program includes:&#xD;
Individualized exercise prescription according to the results of cardiopulmonary exercise test.&#xD;
At least one session of in-person physical therapy to familiarize participants with the process of exercise training before the initiation of telerehabilitation.&#xD;
Telerehabilitation: a 30-minute moderate aerobic exercise training with remote monitoring and instruction using video conferencing. (Frequency: twice per week in the first 4 weeks, once per week in the 5th-8th week, once every 2 weeks in the 9th-12th week)&#xD;
Additional self-exercise to achieve the target volume of 150-minute moderate aerobic exercise and 2 sessions of resistance training per week.&#xD;
Patient education for secondary prevention delivered regularly via a communication app on the smartphone.&#xD;
Weekly follow-up call from a case manager via phone call or communication app.</description>
