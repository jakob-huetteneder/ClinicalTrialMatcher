      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      NOVA intracranial drug-eluting stent system in &quot;real world&quot; patients with intracranial&#xD;
      atherosclerotic stenosis.&#xD;

      The investigation is a prospective, multi-center, single arm clinical study. The trial is&#xD;
      anticipated to last from December 2022 to December 2030 with 1000 subjects recruited in&#xD;
      around 50 Chinese centers. The population for this study is subjects with intracranial&#xD;
      atherosclerotic stenosis who are suitable candidates for stent angioplasty. Patients&#xD;
      fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled&#xD;
      after they signed the informed consent form. The study consists of ten visits including&#xD;
      preoperative screening, operation date, 30 days, 3, 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 years and 5 years.&#xD;
      The primary outcome was a composite of stroke or death within 30 days or any ischemic stroke&#xD;
      or revascularization from the original culprit intracranial artery beyond 30 days through 12&#xD;
      months after operation.&#xD;
