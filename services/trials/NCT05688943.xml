  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares general anesthesia and spinal anesthesia for vNOTE tubal sterilization. A&#xD;
      direct comparison of these methods has not been done before for this surgical approach.&#xD;
      Investigators will aim to compare the two methods to determine the differences in&#xD;
      perioperative complications, postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and the&#xD;
      time to get the patient ready for discharge from the recovery room.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anesthesia is a controlled, temporary loss of sensation or awareness used to perform surgical&#xD;
      procedures. Spinal anesthesia is commonly used in obstetrics and gynecology for vaginal&#xD;
      procedures as well as cesarean sections. The use of spinal anesthesia for laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery is an adequate and safe alternative to general anesthesia which remains the gold&#xD;
      standard. Vaginal Natural Orifice Endoscopic Surgery (vNOTES) is a minimally invasive&#xD;
      laparoscopic approach used for tubal sterilization that is currently performed under general&#xD;
      anesthesia. This study is proposing that spinal anesthesia is an adequate and safe&#xD;
      alternative to general anesthesia for vNOTES tubal sterilization. If participants join the&#xD;
      study, all other routine care will continue but the researchers will randomly assign&#xD;
      participants, like flipping a coin, to one of two groups. Both types of anesthesia are&#xD;
      commonly used but the researchers are doing this study because it is not known if spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia is a better alternative than general anesthesia which is typically used. The goal&#xD;
      is to find out what might be best for future patients. If it turns out the two types of&#xD;
      anesthesia are about the same, then surgeons would know that choosing the type with fewer&#xD;
      side effects still gives satisfactory results and allows for this surgery to be performed&#xD;
      safely. The risks involved in participating in this study are the same as all other&#xD;
      anesthetic and surgical procedures which have significant physical risks. If participants&#xD;
      choose to enroll, there will be a 50/50 chance of being assigned to either the standard of&#xD;
      care group which will receive general anesthesia or the experimental group which will receive&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia. Benefits cannot be guaranteed but, It is possible participants could be&#xD;
      assigned to a type of anesthesia that has fewer side effects.&#xD;

    <description>Fentanyl (1µg/kg) and midazolam are administered intravenously prior to puncture. Using an aseptic technique, the subarachnoid space is punctured with a 25/27 gauge needle in the intervertebral space, and a standard dose of chloroprocaine 45-60mg is injected. The participant is then placed in the supine position in 10-degree Trendelenburg until the lack of sensitivity is adequate at spinal level T4.</description>

During a general anesthetic, medicines are used to send the participant to sleep making the participant unaware of surgery and so that the participant does not move or feel pain while the surgery is carried out.</description>
