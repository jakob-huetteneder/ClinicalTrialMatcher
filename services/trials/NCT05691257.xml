      The purpose of this study is to conduct a a cohort study to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of the efficacy and safety of roxadustat for the treatment of anemia, quality of life and&#xD;
      cardiac function in patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cohort study in patients with anemia with heart failure complicated with chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease, evaluating the the efficacy and safety of roxadustat. Patients were divided&#xD;
      into roxadustat group and control group according to whether roxadustat was used or not. The&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of roxadustat for the treatment of anemia, quality of life and cardiac&#xD;
      function in patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary endpoints will be examined in subgroups determined by baseline&#xD;
      variables reflecting demography, heart failure characteristics, diabetes status, kidney&#xD;
      function, cardiac function, natriuretic peptide, dialysis, and additional co-morbidities,&#xD;
      concomitant medications, and others.&#xD;

    <description>The initial dose of roxadustat was given according to body weight, which was more than 60kg: 100mg (three times a week); Weight less than 60kg: 70mg (three times a week); 2 weeks later, the corresponding indexes were rechecked and medication was adjusted according to hemoglobin. The target is hemoglobin 100-120g/L.&#xD;
Reference for medication Method: The use of roxadustat is the same as the RCT study of roxadustat in the treatment of anemia and the drug instructions of roxadustat published by N Engl J Med in 2019.</description>
