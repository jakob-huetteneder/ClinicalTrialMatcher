  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot feasibility randomized clinical trial comparing a tailored intervention to uniform&#xD;
      standard of care will be conducted. A total of 40 AYAs with cancer will be randomized to one&#xD;
      of the two programs. Data will be collected to explore the hypotheses that the intervention&#xD;
      meets pre-established enrollment, retention, fidelity, and data completion feasibility&#xD;
      criteria and that AYAs will rate the intervention as easy to use and acceptable.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research includes a randomized clinical trial of a tailored adherence-promotion&#xD;
      intervention (Tailored Program) as compared to uniform standard of care (Feedback Program)&#xD;
      for adolescents and young adults with cancer. Up to 40 adolescents and young adults (AYAs)&#xD;
      with cancer will be enrolled in this study. Participants who enroll in this trial will be&#xD;
      given an eCAP electronic monitor, a pill bottle with a computer chip in the cap, to store&#xD;
      their medication. After using the electronic monitor for 4 weeks to assess baseline&#xD;
      adherence, participants who demonstrate non-adherence and have used the electronic monitor&#xD;
      without difficulty will be asked to complete pre-treatment questionnaires. Next, participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either the tailored adherence-promotion intervention group&#xD;
      (Tailored Program) or the uniform standard of care group (Feedback Program). Participants&#xD;
      will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio so that, at the end of the study, an equal number of&#xD;
      participants will have been randomized to each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the tailored program will participate in 4 sessions with a coach, 1 every&#xD;
      other week. During these sessions, the AYA will work with their coach to identify a barrier&#xD;
      to adherence to target and create an action plan using evidence-based behavior change&#xD;
      techniques to address this barrier. In between sessions (on alternating weeks), the coach&#xD;
      will check-in with a text including a reminder about the action plan and a calendar of the&#xD;
      AYA's eCAP adherence data. Participants in the Feedback Program will receive weekly text&#xD;
      messages including: a calendar depicting their weekly adherence (per eCAP data) and guidance&#xD;
      for requesting additional support as desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents and young adults will continue to use the electronic monitor to store their&#xD;
      medication until approximately a month after their program ends. After their program ends,&#xD;
      participants will complete post-treatment questionnaires regarding program usability and&#xD;
      acceptability as well as their adherence.&#xD;
