      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of sarilumab cemiplimab combination in metastatic lung cancer&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary endpoint is DLT for safety Run-In cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To preliminarily assess efficacy of sarilumab cemiplimab combination in patients with&#xD;
           EGFR- or LKB1/STK11-mutant NSCLC respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary efficacy endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) in cohort A and cohort B,&#xD;
           evaluated separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      --To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DOR), duration of&#xD;
      response (DoR), overall survival (OS), and safety and tolerability of this combination in&#xD;
      patients with EGFR- or LKB1-mutant NSCLC respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative/Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the association of baseline genomic profiles (from tumor, germline DNA, and&#xD;
           ctDNA) with clinical benefit in patients treated with sarilumab and cemiplimab&#xD;
           combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the association of immune profiles (tumor immune microenvironment features) with&#xD;
           clinical benefit in patients treated with sarilumab and cemiplimab combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore resistance mechanisms to sarilumab and cemiplimab combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the impact of sarilumab on immunotherapy-related side effects from cemiplimab.&#xD;

             serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of starting of treatment. The patient must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception for a minimum of two weeks prior to receiving&#xD;
             study medication until 3 months after discontinuation of the study medication.&#xD;
             Acceptable methods of contraception include total and true sexual abstinence, hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives that are not prone to drug-drug interactions (IUS Levonorgestrel Intra&#xD;
             Uterine System (Mirena), Medroxyprogesterone injections (Depo-Provera)), copper-banded&#xD;
             intra-uterine devices, and vasectomized partner. All hormonal methods of contraception&#xD;
             should be used in combination with the use of a condom by their sexual male partner.&#xD;
             Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile&#xD;
             (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or&#xD;
             postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical&#xD;
             cause). Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the&#xD;
             past 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific&#xD;
             requirements must also apply: Women &lt; 50 years old: they would be considered&#xD;
             post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months or more following&#xD;
             cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments. The levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and&#xD;
             Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) must also be in the post-menopausal range (as per&#xD;
             the institution). Women ≥ 50 years old: they would be considered post-menopausal if&#xD;
             they have been amenorrheic for the past 12 months or more following cessation of all&#xD;
             exogenous hormonal treatments, or have had radiation-induced oophorectomy with the&#xD;
             last menses &gt; 1 year ago, or have had chemotherapy-induced menopause with &gt;1 year&#xD;
             interval since last menses, or have had surgical sterilization by either bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy or hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must use adequate contraception for the duration of the study and 3 months&#xD;
             after the last dose of study medication. Adequate contraception methods include: birth&#xD;
             control pills (e.g. combined oral contraceptive pill), barrier protection (e.g. condom&#xD;
             plus spermicide, cervical/vault cap or intrauterine device), and abstinence. Patients&#xD;
             should not father a child for 6 months after completion of the study medication.&#xD;
             Patients should refrain from donating sperm from the start of dosing until 6 months&#xD;
             after discontinuing the study medication. If male patients wish to father children&#xD;
             they should be advised to arrange for freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of&#xD;
             the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients who meet eligibility criteria to either Cohort A or B will be allowed to&#xD;
             enroll to the run-in cohort.&#xD;
