      This study will investigate the effectiveness of a modified product &quot;safe breastfeeding&#xD;
      pillow&quot; in enhancing the comfort and safety of postpartum women during breastfeeding. The&#xD;
      results of this study can be used as a reference to promote clinical practice and education&#xD;
      on breastfeeding to prolong the duration of breastfeeding and to ensure the safety of&#xD;
      newborns.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding has a significant long-term positive impact on the health, nutrition and&#xD;
      development of children, as well as the physical and mental health of women. Baby-Friendly&#xD;
      Hospital Initiative (BFHI) was launched by the World Health Organization and UNICEF in 1991&#xD;
      to encourage comfortable, supportive, and safe breastfeeding environments (Byrom et al.,&#xD;
      2021). During breastfeeding, mothers need to maintain the same position with their hands for&#xD;
      long periods of time, which can lead to muscle pain due to improper posture. In addition,&#xD;
      postpartum fatigue can also lead to newborn fall accidents (Lipke et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of a modified pillow to enhance the comfort and&#xD;
      safety of postpartum women during breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Mothers and infants who gave birth&#xD;
      naturally without serious postpartum complications at a university affiliate hospital will&#xD;
      recruit in northern Taiwan. A questionnaire containing &quot;Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale&#xD;
      (BSES)&quot;, &quot;B-R-E-A-S-T-Feed scale&quot;, &quot;Breastfeeding safety scale&quot;, and &quot;Body Part Discomfort&#xD;
      Scale (BPDS)&quot; will be used to assess comfort and safety during breastfeeding.&#xD;
