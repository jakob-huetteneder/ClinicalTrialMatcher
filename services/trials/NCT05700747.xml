  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore whether a structured program can help reduce the&#xD;
      challenges of decreased physical functioning and quality of life for participants with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma by providing a customized exercise program and fostering engagement in&#xD;
      meaningful activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the study intervention involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Through Activity (HTA) (six-session, rehabilitation exercise regimen)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this single arm, pilot study of the Health Through Activity (HTA) rehabilitation&#xD;
      intervention for people living with multiple myeloma is to determine if investigators can&#xD;
      feasibly deliver the program out of the IMPACT Practice Center at the MGH Institute for&#xD;
      Health Professions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The six-session 'Health Through Activity' program provides a customized exercise plan and&#xD;
      encourages engagement in activities to reduce disability and improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study procedures including screening for eligibility, in-clinic visits, questionnaires,&#xD;
           and surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in this research study is expected to last up to 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that up to 20 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An internal grant from the Massachusetts General Hospital Institute of Health Professions is&#xD;
      providing equipment and staffing for this study.&#xD;
