  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open, non-randomized Phase I trial of dose-escalation and cohorts expansion to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, pharmacokinetic profile and initial efficacy of APG-115 alone or in combination&#xD;
      with APG-2575 in the treatment of recurrent or refractory pediatric neuroblastoma or solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1: Dose escalation and expansion of APG-115 monotherapy in pediatric neuroblastoma or&#xD;
      solid tumors to determine MTD and recommended phase 2 dose, RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Dose escalation of APG-2575 to determine the MTD and RP2D combined with APG-115 at&#xD;
      the dose level determined in part 1 in pediatric neuroblastoma or solid tumor, and extend the&#xD;
      RP2D level of the combination therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma or solid tumor.&#xD;

             bowel syndrome) or other malabsorption syndromes that may affect drug absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A known hemorrhagic predisposition/disease, such as a history of&#xD;
             non-chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenic bleeding within 1 year before first&#xD;

             bleeding occurred within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction&#xD;
