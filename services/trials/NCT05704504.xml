  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposed pilot randomized controlled trial is to examine the efficacy&#xD;
      and acceptability of using smartphone-delivered ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and&#xD;
      personalized telephone support to promote adherence to a 6-week group-based exercise&#xD;
      intervention for improving depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to all study procedures, eligible participants are required to complete an online&#xD;
      informed consent via an in-house smartphone application, Longitudinax Pro. Around 60 eligible&#xD;
      participants aged 18-65 years old with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) total score ≥10&#xD;
      (Kroenke et al., 2001) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) total score&#xD;
      &lt;600 MET/week (Lai et al., 2018; Macfarlane et al., 2007) will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      1) group-based exercise intervention with EMA and personalized telephone support (SUP), 2)&#xD;
      group-based exercise intervention (EXE), or no intervention control group (CON) in a ratio of&#xD;
      1:1:1. The randomization will be performed by an independent assessor using a&#xD;
      computer-generated list of numbers. The SUP and EXE groups will participate in a 6-week&#xD;
      group-based exercise intervention. The intervention includes three biweekly group-based&#xD;
      exercise sessions lasting for 120 minutes each (i.e., Week 1, 3, and 5). In addition,&#xD;
      participants in the SUP will receive daily smartphone-delivered EMAs throughout the&#xD;
      intervention period (i.e., 6-week) and 15-minute personalized telephone support delivered by&#xD;
      a research personnel in Week 2, 4, and 6, respectively. Participants in the CON group will&#xD;
      not be given any intervention during the study period but will be advised to remain their&#xD;
      typical lifestyle throughout the trial period. The primary outcome of interest include&#xD;
      depressive symptoms as measured by PHQ-9. The secondary outcomes will include anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms, perceived insomnia severity, quality of life, functional impairment, and&#xD;
      intervention evaluation at immediate post-intervention (Week 7) and 3-month follow-up&#xD;
      assessments (Week 19).&#xD;
