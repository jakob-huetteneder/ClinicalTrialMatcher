  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial that aims at evaluating&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of oral encapsulated fecal microbial transplantation therapy&#xD;
      (MTT) in peanut allergic patients. In this research the investigators would like to learn&#xD;
      more about ways to treat peanut allergies. The primary objective is to evaluate whether MTT&#xD;
      with antibiotic pretreatment can increase the threshold of peanut reactivity during a&#xD;
      double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge from &lt;=100 mg peanut protein to 300 mg after&#xD;
      28 days of MTT /placebo therapy and 4 months post therapy initiation.&#xD;

      This is a phase II randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial that aims at evaluating&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of oral encapsulated fecal microbial transplantation therapy&#xD;
      (MTT) in 24 peanut allergic patients, 12-17 years of age. After reacting to &lt;=100 mg peanut&#xD;
      protein during initial DBPCFC, patients will be randomized to receive either oral Vancomycin&#xD;
      and Neomycin or placebo/placebo for 7 days. Patients will then come to the Experimental and&#xD;
      Therapeutic Unit (ETU) to receive orally 5 capsules of MTT or placebo under medical&#xD;
      supervision. Patients will then take 2 capsules of MTT or placebo daily for 27 days. Patients&#xD;
      will return to the ETU to undergo a second DBPCFC within 2 weeks of end of MTT/placebo&#xD;
      treatment and 4 months post MTT initiation. They will return to the ETU for an exit visit 6&#xD;
      months after end of treatment. Gut microbiota will be analyzed serially using&#xD;
      state-of-the-art 16SRNA sequencing prior to transplantation, then at 4 weeks, 4-month, and 6&#xD;
      months post transplantation. Immunological biomarkers and mechanistic studies will be&#xD;
      performed on blood taken at baseline, second DBPCFC visit and exit visit. Adverse events will&#xD;
      be monitored carefully throughout the study.&#xD;
