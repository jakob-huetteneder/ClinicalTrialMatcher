  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has become a major public health challenge, and the treatment options&#xD;
      for the disease are currently limited. The commonly used oral small-molecule anti-COVID-19&#xD;
      drugs in China are Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir and Azvudine. These drugs have been tested in&#xD;
      pre-marketing clinical trials in patients with non-severe COVID-19 infection and have&#xD;
      demonstrated therapeutic effects in inhibiting virus transmission and preventing disease&#xD;
      progression. However, until now, the efficacy and safety of these drugs in patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe COVID-19 infections remains unclear. Therefore, this study is aiming to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy and safety of Azvudine and Nirmatrelvir-Ritonavir in moderate to severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 infections. This study will be a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      study in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections. Recovery of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, nucleic acid negative conversion, improvement in oxygenation index, and&#xD;
      imaging improvement will be used as study endpoints.&#xD;
