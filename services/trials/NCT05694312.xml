      This is a multicenter, phase II study to assess the efficacy of ibrutinib for the treatment&#xD;
      of AIHA in adult patients with CLL/SLL or CLL-like MBL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive ibrutinib 420 mg/day PO for up to 12 cycles of 28 days in the absence&#xD;
      of CLL progression or unacceptable toxicity. Every patient will be followed-up for 1 year&#xD;
      after the completion of study treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) or CLL-like monoclonal B-cell&#xD;
             lymphocytosis (MBL) according to IWCLL guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients &gt;18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active AIHA (wAIHA or CAD) that i) is relapsed after previous treatment with&#xD;
             corticosteroids (with or without rituximab), or ii) is steroid-resistant (failure to&#xD;
             obtain hematologic response within 3 weeks on at least 1 mg/kg predniso(lo)ne), or&#xD;
             iii) is steroid-dependent (need to continue on predniso(lo)ne at a dose of &gt;10 mg/day&#xD;
             to maintain a response). AIHA is defined as: anemia (hemoglobin â‰¤10 g/dL; or&#xD;
             hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dL dependent on transfusions to maintain this level of hemoglobin)&#xD;
             and laboratory evidence of hemolysis (presence of 3 of 4 markers: increased&#xD;
             reticulocyte count, increased indirect bilirubin, increased lactate dehydrogenase,&#xD;
             decreased haptoglobin) and positive DAT (either IgG DAT, C3 DAT or both).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eligibility of patients with DAT-negative active AIHA should be confirmed by the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator and co-Principal Investigator for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Signed written informed consent according to ICH/EU/GCP and national local laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Contraindication to ibrutinib therapy as per treating physician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Contraindication to ibrutinib therapy as per ibrutinib data sheet (severe hepatic&#xD;
             impairment, known allergy to the drug or to one of the excipients, concomitant&#xD;
             treatment with warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previous exposure to ibrutinib as CLL-directed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Other CLL/SLL- or AIHA-directed treatment at the time of enrollment in the study,&#xD;
             other than corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female patients who are currently in pregnancy or are willing to be pregnant or are&#xD;
             lactating.&#xD;
