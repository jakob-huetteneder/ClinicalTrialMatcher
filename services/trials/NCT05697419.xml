      The goal of this longitudinal prospective cohort study is to determine effectiveness of&#xD;
      integrating NIH reset stress strategies of deep breathing, muscle relaxation and mindfulness&#xD;
      in DPT students in order to help them reduce stress throughout their schooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question[s] it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do performing the NIH reset stress strategies help DPT students manage their stress&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do DPT students find these strategies helpful Participants will be asked to fill out&#xD;
           initial intake forms and participate in weekly sessions of five to ten minutes that will&#xD;
           be either a deep breathing, mindfulness, or muscle relaxation activity led by faculty&#xD;
           member. DPT students will then rate their stress level weekly on a numeric stress scale.&#xD;

      Integrating NIH Reset Stress Strategies into DPT Curriculum A. Investigator Information&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Investigator: Shannon Dudash PT, DPT, GCS&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      a. none E. Methods and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Introduction i. DPT students report higher levels of stress and anxiety compared to their&#xD;
      age matched peers (1). Since 2020, COVID has caused increased stress among students and the&#xD;
      general population (11, 12). Increased stress can negatively impact not only students'&#xD;
      physical conditions but also their academic performance. This may potentially have long term&#xD;
      consequences that carry over into their careers and lead to decreased quality of future&#xD;
      healthcare workers. There is a lack of information on if and how DPT programs address stress&#xD;
      in DPT students in their curriculum. Deep breathing, muscle relaxation and mindfulness are&#xD;
      strategies recommended by the NIH to help manage stress to general public which can&#xD;
      potentially be used by DPT program to help DPT students manage their stress and be&#xD;
      successful. However, there is lack of evidence on the use of these strategies to assist DPT&#xD;
      students manage stress and anxiety during their schooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Background i. Long term stress, or chronic stress, can lead to serious health problems&#xD;
      including disrupted sleep, muscle tension, metabolic dysfunction, immune abnormalities, and&#xD;
      inflammation. Some diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases, depression, and anxiety orders can be linked to chronic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Deep breathing, mindfulness, and muscle relaxation have been used to manage stress in&#xD;
      older and younger adult populations (3, 4, 6, 13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Objectives i. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of integrating&#xD;
      NIH reset stress strategies of deep breathing, muscle relaxation and mindfulness for DPT&#xD;
      students in order to help them reduce stress throughout their schooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d. Study design and procedures i. How the participants will be identified and recruited and&#xD;
      how informed consent will be obtained to minimize coercion or undue influence: The study&#xD;
      design is a longitudinal prospective cohort study. Students in the Doctor of Physical Therapy&#xD;
      program will be recruited by email about the &quot;Integrating NIH Reset Stress Strategies into&#xD;
      DPT Curriculum&quot; project, NIH Reset Stress flyer, and an informed consent form from the&#xD;
      student worker in the Graduate of Health Sciences department. A recruitment flyer will be&#xD;
      posted within the department. Also, a current student will recruit within the DPT classes. If&#xD;
      students choose to participate, they will turn in their signed informed consent to Shannon&#xD;
      Dudash by the end of week 1 of the spring semester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Procedures for data collection: Initial meeting will be established with participants to&#xD;
      fill out intake paperwork including survey asking if participants know what deep breathing,&#xD;
      muscle relaxation, and mindfulness are, demographic information, DASS-21, PSS-10 and Stress&#xD;
      Numeric Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Procedures to which human subjects will be exposed: Reset Stress sessions will be&#xD;
      administered prior to the start of a weekly class by the course instructor (Shannon Dudash).&#xD;
      The focus of the sessions will be a combination of mindfulness, deep breathing, and muscle&#xD;
      relaxation. These sessions will last approximately 5-10 minutes. Sessions will be performed&#xD;
      in a group setting. There will be a total of 12-14 sessions administered throughout the 2023&#xD;
      Spring semester at YSU on a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Procedures for data collection: Participants will fill out a Stress Numeric Scale after&#xD;
      each weekly intervention session. Participants will also be asked to complete the DASS-21,&#xD;
      Stress Numeric Scale, and PSS-10 at a midpoint check-in during week 6 and at the end of the&#xD;
      project. An additional survey at the end of the project inquiring if it was helpful to learn&#xD;
      these stress management strategies and how frequently participants used them independently&#xD;
      will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. Any paper forms used will not have any identification on them to protect participant&#xD;
      privacy. Anonymous Slido presentation will be used to collect weekly Stress Numeric scale&#xD;
      ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi. Data Analysis will include comparison of surveys from start to completion of sessions. We&#xD;
      will use a repeated measure ANOVA to look at trends of Stress Numeric scale over the spring&#xD;
      semester. Descriptive analysis will also include participants' responses on how frequently&#xD;
      they used the stress management strategies independently and if they found that the&#xD;
      strategies taught were beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e. No deception is to be used in this study. f. Participants will not be presented with&#xD;
      materials that they might regard to be offensive, threatening or degrading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Risk/Benefit Assessment a. Potential risks: It is unlikely, but the participants might&#xD;
      have negative feelings by recalling previous experience when completing the questionaries. It&#xD;
      will be no more than what they feel in normal daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Potential benefits: Benefits from this study include learning different strategies to&#xD;
      control stress. Implementing the strategies may reduce stress, improve physical conditions,&#xD;
      and improve academic performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. Human Research Participants&#xD;
