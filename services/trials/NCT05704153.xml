  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the causality relationship between the&#xD;
      non vagus nerve stimulation waveform parameters and the therapeutic effect. Thus, unlocking a&#xD;
      pathway to optimize parameters that maximize the benefits of therapy and minimize unwanted&#xD;
      side effects. The experimental design includes the analysis of physiological signals,&#xD;
      clinical biomarkers of disease, and clinical outcomes to determine the most effective&#xD;
      measures for the monitoring, optimization, and personalization of non vagus nerve stimulation&#xD;
      in systemic lupus erythematosus disease.&#xD;

    <description>We will develop an nVNS platform with an integrated nVNS decision support system, including nVNS and physiological wearable sensors, that will optimize nVNS waveform parameters to maximize the therapeutic effect while minimizing unwanted side effects.
