      The Health Advocate for Liver Transplant (HEAL-Tx) Pilot is a nonrandomized, open-label&#xD;
      intervention pilot of a health advocate intervention aimed to assess feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of integrating a Health Advocate onto the transplant team. Across studies,&#xD;
      health advocate roles vary, and can include coordinating medical care treatment, facilitating&#xD;
      financial assistance (e.g., taxi vouchers), and connecting patients to community resources,&#xD;
      which can improve self-management, mitigate social risks, and lead to better communication&#xD;
      between the healthcare system and the family. In this pilot, the investigators will adapt&#xD;
      this intervention for pediatric liver transplant patients and measure acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility according to RE-AIM.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in caregiver experience</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will administer a survey of caregiver experiences at study enrollment and at the end of the intervention to assess for changes in caregiver experience with the transplant team. These questions will focus on experiences receiving transplant care, experiences discussing social needs with the transplant team, and overall caregiver subjective assessment of the transplant recipient's overall health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in medication adherence using MLVI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 90 days, and 180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Medication level variability index (MLVI) defined as the standard deviation of 3 outpatient tacrolimus trough levels (binary &gt;/=2.0 or &lt;2.0). The investigators will assess this at study entry, intervention completion, and 6 months after study entry.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The quality of health advocate interactions with the participants, healthcare team, and community-based resources.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Advocate will keep a detailed journal entry after each encounter and certain Health Advocate interactions will be recorded. The investigators will qualitatively analyze these journal entries and recordings to identify what functions the health advocate undertook.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>A qualitative assessment of caregiver and healthcare provider satisfaction with the Health Advocate intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will conduct in-depth interviews with the caregiver participant and clinical team members to assess overall satisfaction with the intervention.</description>
