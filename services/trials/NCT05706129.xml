    <textblock>
      The main purpose of Part A of the study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and tracer uptake&#xD;
      after a single intravenous (IV) administration of [68Ga]Ga-DPI-4452; Part B: is to determine&#xD;
      the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) [maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or lower dose] for&#xD;
      [177Lu]Lu-DPI-4452 for each tumor type; Part C: is to evaluate the preliminary antitumor&#xD;
      activity of [177Lu]Lu-DPI-4452 as monotherapy.&#xD;
