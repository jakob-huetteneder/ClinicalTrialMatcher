      The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a central venous catheter (CVC) care&#xD;
      protocol, which was created using current guidelines, research results, and expert opinions,&#xD;
      on developing CVC-related bloodstream infection in patients with hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT) until discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is one of the important treatment approaches&#xD;
      that prolongs survival in patients with hematological malignancies, immunodeficiency and some&#xD;
      solid tumors. Despite advances in the treatment process, reasons such as recurrence of the&#xD;
      underlying disease, organ toxicities and infectious complications adversely affect treatment&#xD;
      success. Reasons such as high-dose chemotherapy, frequent blood sampling, stem cell&#xD;
      reinfusion, and total parenteral nutrition applied to HSCT patients increase the need for&#xD;
      central venous catheter insertion. Although these tools are often necessary and useful in the&#xD;
      bone marrow transplantation process, they also bring mechanical, embolic, and infectious&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central venous catheters (CVC) are one of the main applications of modern clinical treatment.&#xD;
      Reasons such as high-dose chemotherapy, frequent blood sampling, stem cell reinfusion, and&#xD;
      total parenteral nutrition applied to HSCT patients increase the need for central venous&#xD;
      catheter insertion. Although these tools are often necessary and valuable in the bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation process, they also bring mechanical, embolic, and infectious complications.&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a central venous catheter (CVC) care&#xD;
      protocol, created using current guidelines, research results, and expert opinions, on&#xD;
      developing CVC-related bloodstream infection in patients with hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT) until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental clinical study. It is conducted with&#xD;
      60 patients between January 2022 and December 2023. The data is collected with Patient&#xD;
      Information Form and Daily Patient Evaluation Chart. No application will be made to 30&#xD;
      patients in the control group, and catheter care will be provided to the patients of the&#xD;
      intervention group in line with the CVC Care Protocol created by the researchers.&#xD;

    <description>It was developed by the researchers by examining the literature; It contains information about the socio-demographic characteristics of the patients such as age, gender, marital status, educational status, and the planned chemotherapy protocol, previous treatments, and medical conditions such as chronic diseases. There are 8 questions in the first part of the form, which includes socio-demographic characteristics, and 12 questions in the second part, which includes information on medical status..</description>

    <measure>Daily Patient Evaluation Chart</measure>
    <time_frame>During the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>It was developed by researchers by examining the literature; patients' vital signs (recording of signs of infection such as hypotension, tachycardia, high fever), height-weight measurement results, daily central venous catheter insertion site control results (evaluation findings such as exudate, swelling, redness, discharge, etc.) and routine clinical procedures from patients every day. This is the chart in which the results of whole blood, CRP, Procalcitonin, sedimentation count values and hemoculture routinely taken at every fever, urine culture and catheter tip culture taken during discharge will be recorded. It also includes the control of the protocol implementation steps.</description>

    <description>Catheter care is provided in line with the CVC care protocol developed by the researcher:&#xD;
For subsequent catheter care, a transparent sterile catheter cover impregnated with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate will be used.&#xD;
The entry point of the catheter will be wiped with a disposable sterile skin cleaning applicator containing 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate and 70% Isopropyl Alcohol, which will be provided by the researchers, and wait for it to dry.&#xD;
Vein valve/needleless connector will be used.&#xD;
Effective manual disinfection of needle-free connectors (hubs) will be ensured before each intervention.&#xD;
Needle-free connectors will be replaced every 96 hours at the latest.&#xD;
If necessary, the catheter lumen will be washed with a disposable, positive-pressure sterile washing system containing 10 ccs 0.9% sodium chloride to be provided by the investigators.&#xD;
Pulsatile &quot;give stop give stop&quot; technique will be used in the washing process.</description>
