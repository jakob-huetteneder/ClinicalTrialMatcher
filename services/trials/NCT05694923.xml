      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a major health problem worldwide with an&#xD;
      increasing prevalence ranging from 13% in Africa to 42% in South-East Asia. The term NAFLD&#xD;
      includes a variety of diseases, ranging from liver fat deposition in more than 5% of&#xD;
      hepatocytes (steatosis-non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)) to necroinflammation and fibrosis&#xD;
      (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)), which can progress into NASH-cirrhosis, and&#xD;
      eventually to hepatocellular carcinoma 1 Lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstone of&#xD;
      NAFLD treatment, even though various pharmaceutical interventions are currently under&#xD;
      clinical trial. Among them, sodium-glucose co-transporter type-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) are&#xD;
      emerging as promising agents. Processes regulated by SGLT-2i, such as endoplasmic reticulum&#xD;

&#xD;
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a major health problem worldwide with an&#xD;
      increasing prevalence ranging from 13% in Africa to 42% in South-East Asia. The term NAFLD&#xD;
      includes a variety of diseases, ranging from liver fat deposition in more than 5% of&#xD;
      hepatocytes (steatosis-non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD)) to necroinflammation and fibrosis&#xD;
      (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)), which can progress into NASH-cirrhosis, and&#xD;
      eventually to hepatocellular carcinoma 1 Lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstone of&#xD;
      NAFLD treatment, even though various pharmaceutical interventions are currently under&#xD;
      clinical trial. Among them, sodium-glucose co-transporter type-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) are&#xD;

      (ER) and oxidative stress, low-grade inflammation, autophagy and apoptosis are all implicated&#xD;
      in NAFLD pathogenesis 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      In non-DM patients, only a small single center study exists which studied 12 patients under&#xD;
      dapagliflozin and 10 patients under teneligliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor, for a total of 12 weeks,&#xD;
      showing that after this intervention period, serum transaminases were decreased in both&#xD;
      groups, while in the dapagliflozin group, total body water and body fat decreased, leading to&#xD;
      decreased total body weight.3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate efficacy of sodium glucose cotransporter inhibitors to improve outecomes among&#xD;
      non diabetic non alcoholic fatty liver patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Designs Single center clinical randomized trial open labelled study 150 patients of non&#xD;
      diabetic non alcoholic fatty liver from outpatient clinic at assiut university will be&#xD;
      randomized and recruited into arms Group A Will receive empaglifizon sodium glucose&#xD;
      cotransporter in minimum dose 10 mg Group B Will be Instructed for diet control&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be initially evaluated Full history medical history include Age .Sex Family&#xD;
      history of DM ,HX OF HTN DRUG INTAKE history of ALCOHOL intake ..smoking Hx of fatigue&#xD;
      Examination weight ,BMI ,waist circumference ,skin manifestation of insulin resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver enzymes (AlT â€¦AST) Serology HCV Ab,HBsAg Fasting blood glucose ,2 hour blood glucoe&#xD;
      HBA1C Lipid profile ,urine analysis TSH HOMA R ABDOMINAL US WILL BE DONE FOR ALL PATINTS&#xD;
      Assesment of liver steatosis and fibrosis Fibroscan will be done initially for all cases&#xD;
