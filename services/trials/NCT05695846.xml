      After defining the manometric characteristics of UES incompetence associated with documented&#xD;
      pharyngeal reflux, we will determine the reproducibility of manometric criteria for UES&#xD;
      incompetence in prevention of pharyngeal reflux. We hypothesize that these criteria are&#xD;
      comprised of either a single or constellation of manometric abnormalities. After determining&#xD;
      the ability of externally applied cricoid cartilage pressure in preventing pharyngeal reflux,&#xD;
      we further hypothesize that this approach will eliminate or reduce esophago-pharyngeal reflux&#xD;
      by enhancing the UES pressure barrier. We anticipate there will be a close spatial&#xD;
      correlation between the site of applied pressure and area of increased pressure within UES&#xD;
      high pressure zone. Lastly, we will determine and characterize the effect of externally&#xD;
      applied cricoid cartilage pressure on related functions such as belch and swallow, testing&#xD;
      the hypothesis that these functions will not be impaired.&#xD;

      Study subjects: we will study gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients with complaint&#xD;
      of regurgitation and one of the following supra-esophageal symptoms attributed to reflux of&#xD;
      gastric content: chronic cough, frequent throat clearing, history of non-deglutitive&#xD;
      aspiration pneumonia, hoarse voice, chronic sinusitis and dental erosion i.e. Supraesophageal&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (SE-GERD). The presence of GERD will be verified in their&#xD;
      records by result of prior endoscopy or pH monitoring within the past two years. It not, they&#xD;
      will undergo transnasal esophagogastroduodenoscopy (T-EGD). If negative, they will undergo pH&#xD;
      monitoring off medications to ascertain presence of GERD according to clinically accepted&#xD;
      criteria (AGA guidelines (39). We will not enroll patients with functional heartburn (Rome&#xD;
      III criteria (40). For Supra-esophageal complications we will use the endoscopic criteria&#xD;
      used in clinical Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) practice and validated symptom severity index&#xD;
      questionnaire (developed by Belafsky et al) with the help of our otolaryngologist&#xD;
      co-investigator Dr. Joel Blumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of study subjects and endo-detection of pharyngeal reflux: because so much is&#xD;
      unknown about Upper Esophageal Sphincter (UES) incompetence in various patient groups and&#xD;
      lack of a gold standard reliable method for documentation of pharyngeal reflux, we had to&#xD;
      make the following decision based on our preliminary studies to fulfill the goals of this&#xD;
      project efficiently: a. in order to be able to study adequate number of pharyngeal reflux&#xD;
      events in a manageable number of participants we chose GERD patients with complaint of&#xD;
      regurgitation and supra-esophageal symptoms because of their high likelihood of developing&#xD;
      pharyngeal reflux based on our preliminary studies and b. to avoid any doubt about occurrence&#xD;
      of pharyngeal reflux which is inherent to pH and impedance monitoring due to their recording&#xD;
      from a small section of the pharynx which may not be affected by refluxes of small volume in&#xD;
      addition to their performance ambiguity in the pharynx, we chose to use endoscopic&#xD;
      visualization of the refluxate after developing this technique as our gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study position: studies will be done in supine postures due to vulnerability of the airway in&#xD;
      this position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumentation: all instrumentations will be trans-nasal following application of 2%&#xD;
      lidocaine limited to the nasal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study technique: concurrent video-pharyngo-laryngoscopy and combined high-resolution&#xD;
      manometry and impedance recording along with pH monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will give written informed consent followed by filling out a general&#xD;
      health questionnaire. Additionally, a Belafsky Index will also be filled out in the same&#xD;
      session by the study participant to assess the level of symptoms within the last month&#xD;
      associated with supraesophageal reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined manometric/impedance/pH recording: we will use combined solid-state high resolution&#xD;
      manometry and impedance catheter with 36 circumferential pressure sensors, spaced 1 cm apart&#xD;
      (Sierra Scientific, Los Angeles, CA) 18 impedance sensor couplets spaced 2 cm apart measuring&#xD;
      at a sample rate of 40 Hz (Given Imaging Duluth, GA), 3 pH sensors spaced 7 and 10 cm&#xD;
      respectively. The catheter will be introduced transnasally in a fashion that at least 3&#xD;
      proximal manometric sensors are in the pharynx and two impedance and one pH sensors are&#xD;
      located 2 cm proximal to upper margin of UES in the pharynx. With this arrangement 3-4&#xD;
      manometric and one or two impedance couplets will be positioned in the UES high pressure zone&#xD;
      while the remaining pressure sensors will cover the sub-sphincteric striated segment and the&#xD;
      rest of esophagus along with lower esophageal sphincter (LES) through very proximal portion&#xD;
      of stomach, although in very tall participants the full length of LES may not be covered. One&#xD;
      ph sensor will be 3cm distal to UES while the remaining impedance couplets will span the&#xD;
      proximal and distal esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent videopharyngo-laryngoscopy: to monitor concurrently the pharynx and larynx for&#xD;
      entry of simulated refluxate we will use a Pentax FNL-10AP laryngopharyngoscope passed&#xD;
      through the other nostril and positioned within the pharynx such that the UES inlet, vocal&#xD;
      cords and pyriform sinuses are visualized. The laryngopharyngoscopic images will be&#xD;
      synchronized with manometric/impedance/pH recordings by importing and superimposing the&#xD;
      endoscopic images onto high resolution manometric recordings. Using a specially designed&#xD;
      timer (Thalner Electronics Labs, Inc, Ann Arbor, MI) time in hundredths of a second will be&#xD;
      superimposed on the video images for durational analyses of endoscopic images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slow and rapid intraesophageal infusion: A 3 mm outer diameter injection tube will be placed&#xD;
      through the same nostril in a fashion that the injection port will be located 5-7cm above the&#xD;
      manometrically determined upper border of lower esophageal sphincter (LES). With this&#xD;
      arrangement gastroesophageal reflux events will be simulated by intra-esophageal injection of&#xD;
      body temperature infusates namely,1/2 normal saline (its ionic nature helps impedance&#xD;
      recording and identification of intra-esophageal distribution), 0.1 N HCl. As stated above&#xD;
      infusions will be done in three sessions. Slow acid and slow1/2saline sessions will test two&#xD;
      volumes (20 and 60ml) and two rates (.05 and 1.0 ml pre second). Since our preliminary data&#xD;
      suggest a strong differentiating capacity for slow infusion (1ml/sec) in uncovering UES&#xD;
      abnormalities we propose to test two slow infusions to identify the one with most&#xD;
      differentiating capacity. We study slow acid and saline perfusion in two sessions to avoid&#xD;
      the issue of esophageal sensitization effect on saline distension in addition to reasons&#xD;
      describe above. The rapid injection session will test two volumes (20 and 60 ml) and one rate&#xD;
      (10 ml per second). In this session we will test both acid and saline due to short contact&#xD;
      time of the acid which make the sensitization less likely. A modified Harvard pump will be&#xD;
      used for infusions. Each infusion will be repeated three times. The order of infused material&#xD;
      as well as the volume of infused material in all sessions will be randomized. Also&#xD;
      randomized, will be the three different study sessions. Liquid infusates will be colored&#xD;
      green using food dye for ease of recognition of pharyngeal reflux. Exact timing and type of&#xD;
      the injection will be documented using the event marker feature of the ManoscanÂ® system. Each&#xD;
      perfusion will be performed only when the UES, esophagus and LES are at baseline for at least&#xD;
      three tidal volume respiratory cycles and 20s after a preceding peristaltic event. After each&#xD;
      perfusion, manometry will be carefully monitored for 20s and then subjects will be cued to&#xD;
      swallow and clear their esophageal contents. Esophageal clearance will be verified by the&#xD;
      presence of an effective peristalsis and return of intra-esophageal impedance and pressure to&#xD;
      baseline. As stated above infusions will be done in three sessions within the same two hour&#xD;
      study visit.. Endoscopic views of pharynx will be watched carefully during infusions. At the&#xD;
      first sign of reflux, perfusion will be stopped and participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      swallow to avoid any potential airway compromise. This technique has been used in our&#xD;
      laboratory for the past three years without any problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure Data Analysis: All pressure measurements will be recorded at a 35HZ frequency and&#xD;
      measured in reference to the atmospheric pressure UES and LES pressures will be measured&#xD;
      utilizing the e-sleeve function of the Manoview Â® software. All UES, LES and esophageal&#xD;
      baseline pressures will be measured as peaks and troughs over 3 tidal volume respiratory&#xD;
      cycles at stable resting conditions when no pharyngeal, gastric, esophageal, UES or LES&#xD;
      events are present. Type, frequency, amplitude, onset, and duration of the UES response along&#xD;
      with the LES and esophageal body response will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UES pressure response to intraesophageal infusion: Percent UES relaxation and percent UES&#xD;
      contraction will be calculated as a fraction of the maximum possible relaxation (baseline UES&#xD;
      pressure-proximal esophageal pressure) and as a fraction of the maximum UES contraction&#xD;
      pressure, respectively. UES relaxation will be considered complete (100%) if an audible belch&#xD;
      is documented or the nadir UES pressure at least equalizes to the proximal esophageal&#xD;
      pressure. Due to considerable variability of the resting UES pressure even at rest we have&#xD;
      set a conservative threshold (10 mmHg) for determining the UES response (43-44). UES response&#xD;
      will be categorized as an ordinal variable: contraction (UES pressure exceeds the peak&#xD;
      baseline pressure by more than 10 mmHg); relaxation (UES pressure drops more than 10 mmHg&#xD;
      below baseline trough pressure); or no response. It has been observed that often prior to and&#xD;
      almost always after a swallow related UES relaxation (as UES participates in&#xD;
      pharyngoesophageal peristaltic wave) there is an increase in UES tone that has been linked to&#xD;
      the preceding relaxation rather than an independent event therefore, we will consider the UES&#xD;
      contraction as a response only if it is not preceded by a UES relaxation response and not&#xD;
      followed by UES relaxation within 3 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extent of esophageal intraluminal pressure increase during infusions: will be recorded as an&#xD;
      ordinal variable: 1) if esophageal pressure increase more than 3 mmHg above baseline during&#xD;
      perfusion, esophageal pressure and peak rate of pressure increase (dp/dt) within a 0.1 s&#xD;
      window will be measured during the perfusion in the proximal and distal esophageal segments&#xD;
      as continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal clearing response to intra-esophageal perfusion: will be classified into four&#xD;
      categories: 1/ simultaneous esophageal contraction (&gt;20 mmHg); 2/ secondary peristalsis as a&#xD;
      sequential esophageal contraction of at least 5cm length and amplitude greater than 20 mmHg&#xD;
      without preceding swallow related pharyngeal contraction); 3/ primary peristalsis (&gt;20 mmHg)&#xD;
      as an orderly sequential esophageal contraction of at least 5cm length and amplitude greater&#xD;
      than 20 mmHg preceded by pharyngeal contraction and UES relaxation ; and, 4/ no response as&#xD;
      the esophageal body pressure changes less than 20 mmHg or 5cm length during 20 second&#xD;
      analysis window. We will monitor clearance of the infusate from esophagus by impedance&#xD;
      monitoring up to 60 seconds and then subjects will be instructed to swallow until esophageal&#xD;
      contents clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LES response to intraesophageal perfusion: Although LES function is not the center of present&#xD;
      proposal when available its response to infusion will be classified into three types: 1/&#xD;
      complete relaxation defined as equalization of the LES pressure to gastric pressure; 2/&#xD;
      partial relaxation defined as a pressure drop &gt; 5 mmHg; and, 3/ no response. The predominant&#xD;
      UES, LES and esophageal response will be considered mode of three trials and recorded as an&#xD;
      ordinal variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Videoendoscopic data analysis: onset of the entry of colored refluxate into the pharynx&#xD;
      though the UES inlet will be determined and correlated with the UES, esophageal and LES&#xD;
      pressure phenomena, impedance and pH events. Endoscopic documentation of pharyngeal reflux&#xD;
      will be considered the gold standard and impedance and pH data will be compared to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of biologic events: Glottal kinetics and movements as well as changes in the&#xD;
      geometry of pharyngeal cavity will be used to identify swallow esophago-glottal closure&#xD;
      reflex and belch. Belch and swallow will also be identified by their characteristic pressure&#xD;
      and impedance signatures, investigator observation and participant signaling using a marker&#xD;
      and correlated with endoscopic findings for certainty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for abnormal UES barrier function: Based on our preliminary data these include,&#xD;
      presence of one or any constellation of the following: absence of sustained UES contraction,&#xD;
      transient partial or complete relaxation. Additional criteria may include absence of striated&#xD;
      esophagus peristalsis or absence of secondary peristalsis. Presence of simultaneous&#xD;
      contraction or lack any contraction. These criteria will be applied to infusion period (60&#xD;
      sec) plus two minute post-infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for normal UES barrier function: sustained contraction of at least 20mmHg above&#xD;
      pre-infusion period (three respiratory cycles) in response to infusion for the duration of&#xD;
      infusion and lack of the abnormal criteria stated above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the ability of externally applied cricoids cartilage pressure on preventing&#xD;
      pharyngeal reflux: Our preliminary studies have shown that externally applied pressure on the&#xD;
      cricoid cartilage (20mmHg) can increase the intraluminally recorded UES pressure. These&#xD;
      studies have also shown that this technique can prevent experimentally induced pharyngeal&#xD;
      reflux in patients with SE-GERD and regurgitation. UES high pressure zone ranges from 3-4cm&#xD;
      and is generated by participation of inferior pharyngeal constrictor, cricopharyngeus muscle&#xD;
      and most proximal part of the esophagus. The spatial relationship of externally applied&#xD;
      pressure and the UES pressure profile has not been studied. It is also not known whether&#xD;
      external pressures applied, not exactly on the cricoid could impart the same effect. Our&#xD;
      preliminary data suggests location dependent effect on UES pressure profile. Because this&#xD;
      approach may have practical clinical ramification, in this sub-aim, we will characterize the&#xD;
      effect of a 20mmHg pressure, externally applied to and several points distal and proximal to&#xD;
      the cricoid cartilage on UES pressure profile. We have chosen 20 mmHg pressure based on our&#xD;
      preliminary data. This procedure will be performed on all EPR patients recruited into our&#xD;
      study. Each apparatus for exerting external cricoid pressure is custom fitted for each&#xD;
      subject at the time of the study. Furthermore, the ICF for this protocol has been edited to&#xD;
      include this procedure in the description of test performed during each experiment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine and characterize the effect of externally applied cricoid cartilage pressure on&#xD;
      related functions such as belch and swallow: We will test dry, 5 and 10 ml Â½ saline&#xD;
      swallowsX3 in random order. In addition we will test belching by injecting various volumes of&#xD;
      air into the esophagus through the previously paced infusion catheter. We will test 20 and 40&#xD;
      ml room TX3. Studies will be done with and without application of cricoid pressure. Cricoid&#xD;
      pressure will be applied at 20mmHg by using our laboratory made neck band as described above&#xD;
      with the exception that the pressure bar will be 10X30mm to cover the width of the cricoid&#xD;
      cartilage for maximum effect. These studies will be carried out with the test subjects in the&#xD;
      upright and supine positions.&#xD;
