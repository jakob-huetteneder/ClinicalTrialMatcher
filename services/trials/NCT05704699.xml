  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To our knowledge, as of this day there are only four studies which examined the effects of&#xD;
      eTRE with a duration of 12 weeks. There are no studies that examined this phenomenon beyond&#xD;
      12 weeks, one study that lasted five weeks and four studies that lasted 4 weeks or less, some&#xD;
      even days. The four studies that lasted 12 weeks in duration all have opportunities to&#xD;
      improve upon, which will be discussed here. The first study performed by Gabel et al.,&#xD;
      focused primarily on measuring body weight, not body composition in older adults. The eating&#xD;
      window also began later in the morning at 1000h and finished at 1800h. There also was no&#xD;
      restriction on participants consuming caffeine during the fasting window. The second study&#xD;
      conducted by Gasmi et al., was focused on strictly older male participants that were active&#xD;
      and healthy, again, without measuring body composition. The third study conducted by&#xD;
      Wilkinson et al., did not measure body composition and the eating window lasted 10 hours&#xD;
      instead of 8. The fourth study performed by Chow et al., examined eTRE with adults aged&#xD;
      45+/-12 years old and did not mention any exclusion criteria based upon physical activity&#xD;
      levels or restrictions on caffeine/artificial sweetener intake during the fasting window.&#xD;
      Furthermore, none of the studies mentioned above examined eTRE against eTRE with Brief&#xD;
      Intense Stair Climbing (BISC) directly. We believe that the proposed study will address the&#xD;
      concerns mentioned previously and further knowledge associated with eTRE.&#xD;
