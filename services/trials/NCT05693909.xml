  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about SP-420 ability to remove iron from organs&#xD;
      in subjects with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia. The main questions it aims to answer&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How efficient is SP-420 in cleaning iron from the liver?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How is the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of SP-420?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take medication three time weekly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attend up to 20 site visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undergo MRI scans&#xD;

             pills, implants, transdermal patches, hormonal vaginal devices or injections with&#xD;
             prolonged release)) during the whole trial period and 4 weeks post-dosing. A sterile&#xD;
             sole partner or sexual abstinence is also considered acceptable provided it reflects&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
         26. Any other laboratory abnormality, medical condition, or psychiatric disorder which, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the Investigator, will put the subject's disease management at risk or&#xD;
             may result in the subject being unable to comply with the trial requirements&#xD;
