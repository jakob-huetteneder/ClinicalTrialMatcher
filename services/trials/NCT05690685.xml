      Post market surveillance study to confirm the ongoing safety and performance of Silver I&#xD;
      Alginate Non-Woven Dressing (Hydro-Alginate) in chronic and acute wounds.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: The design of the study is an open-label, multicentre, single arm clinical trial in&#xD;
      subjects with moderate to heavily exuding chronic and acute wounds consisting of Pressure&#xD;
      ulcers and Donor sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the chosen study design and objectives is based on the requirement for&#xD;
      further confirmation of the clinical effectiveness and safety of the dressing in routine&#xD;
      clinical use, in terms of management of wound, management of bioburden, maintaining a moist&#xD;
      wound environment, and exudate management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This post market study has been designed to be an in-market clinical evaluation. Using the&#xD;
      assessment scale of &quot;satisfactory&quot; or &quot;not satisfactory&quot; will indicate whether the device is&#xD;
      acceptable to the Healthcare Professional and therefore demonstrate the acceptability of the&#xD;
      Silver I Alginate Non-Woven dressing (Hydro-Alginate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is intended to recruit 25-30 subjects per wound type in support of providing evidence of&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of wound dressings. The prior CE-marking evaluation for this device&#xD;
      lacked information pertaining to the use of the device in pressure ulcers or donor site&#xD;
      wounds. Therefore, this study will address this gap. This study analysis will be descriptive&#xD;
      in nature, for each wound type and will not be based on any stand-alone statistical&#xD;
      hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study endpoints have been chosen because they will demonstrate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the dressing in routine clinical use.&#xD;

    <description>wound progression from baseline to end of follow-up.&#xD;
In order to be considered successful in wound progression, at least one of the following must occur in the change from baseline to the end of follow-up:&#xD;
Increase in % of wound granulation tissue&#xD;
Decrease in wound size (volume, area, or depth) or wound closure&#xD;
Decrease in devitalized tissue&#xD;
In addition to the following:&#xD;
â€¢ Reduction or no signs or symptoms of clinical infection.</description>

    <measure>Pain assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in patient pain (using Visual Analog Score for pain-VAS Score) from baseline to end of follow-up.&#xD;
Min-Max VAS score: 0=no pain to 10=worst pain imaginable. Higher pain VAS score would mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in wound odour (using Verbal Numeric Scale- VNS score), from baseline to end of follow-up.&#xD;
Min-Max score: 0= no odour to 4= Smell is present but is perceived as extremely offensive.&#xD;
A higher odour VNS score would mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Ease of use assessment using Likert-type scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician satisfaction with the device (conformability and ease of use) will be assessed using a Likert-type scale.&#xD;
Min-Max score: 1=Very easy to 5=Very difficult. A higher score would mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Rates of individual components of the primary efficacy endpoint, including:&#xD;
Increase in % of wound granulation tissue&#xD;
Decrease in wound size (volume, area, or depth) or wound closure&#xD;
Decrease in devitalized tissue&#xD;
Reduction or no signs or symptoms of clinical infection.&#xD;
For each of these components, the frequency and proportion of successes will be calculated for each wound type.</description>

    <measure>The number of components of the primary efficacy endpoint experienced by each subject</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>

Increase in % of wound granulation tissue&#xD;
Decrease in wound size (volume, area, or depth) or would closure&#xD;
Decrease in devitalized tissue&#xD;
Reduction or no signs or symptoms of clinical infection&#xD;
For each subject, the number of successful primary efficacy endpoint components will be calculated (range: 0 - 4). Subjects missing data on any of the four primary efficacy endpoint components will be excluded from this secondary endpoint analysis. Descriptive statistics will be provided for the number of successful primary efficacy endpoint components for each wound type, treating the number of components as a continuous variable.</description>
