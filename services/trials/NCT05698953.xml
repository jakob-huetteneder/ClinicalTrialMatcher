  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted based on randomized controlled experimental design with double-blind,&#xD;
      pre-test-post-test to determine the effect of Reiki applied to pediatric oncology patients&#xD;
      aged 5-7 years on pain, vital signs, oxygen saturation (SpO2) and quality of life. While the&#xD;
      population of the study consisted of oncology patients aged 5-7 years who were hospitalized&#xD;
      in the pediatric oncology services between December 2020 and November 2021, the sample&#xD;
      consisted of 66 children diagnosed with leukemia who met the sample selection criteria. The&#xD;
      research consists of 3 groups. These groups are Reiki group (n=22), Placebo group (n=22),&#xD;
      control group (n=22). The data are collected using Introductory Information Form, Wong-Baker&#xD;
      FACES Pain Scale (W-BPS), Vital Signs Follow-up Form, The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory&#xD;
      (PedsQL) 3.0 Cancer Module Child and Parent Form. Reiki was applied to the Reiki group for&#xD;
      20-30 minutes for three consecutive days and Placebo was applied to the sham Reiki group by&#xD;
      an independent nurse during the same application period. The children in the control group&#xD;
      were like the routine of the ward.&#xD;

      The universe of the study consisted of pediatric oncology patients who met the selection&#xD;
      criteria in the pediatric oncology services. The study was planned as a randomized controlled&#xD;
      experimental design with double-blind, pre-test post-test to determine the effect of Reiki&#xD;
      applied to pediatric oncology patients aged 5-7 years on pain, vital signs, oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (SpO2) and quality of life. In order for the groups to be distributed homogeneously, the&#xD;
      order produced by a computer program (http://www.randomization.com , Balanced permutation)&#xD;
      was used. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the study&#xD;
      assigned to the experimental and control groups according the randomization list. The control&#xD;
      variable of the study is demographic characteristics of the children. The dependent variables&#xD;
      of the study are pain, vital signs, oxygen saturation parameters and quality of life score.&#xD;

    <description>The Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale revised (W-BFS) was used to determine the level of pain during the procedure.&#xD;
The W-BFS is a scale that is most commonly used in identifying pain in children of the ages 3 to 18. It is reported that the scale is reliable when used with children older than the age of 3 who can verbally express the degree of pain they feel. The scale is made up of faces and numbers. Pain is assessed on a scale of &quot;0&quot; to &quot;10.&quot; Pain is described by selecting the facial expression depicting the degree of perceived pain.</description>
