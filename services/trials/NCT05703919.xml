  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to test titrated oxygen in prehospital patients with&#xD;
      suspected acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) treated with&#xD;
      inhaled bronchodilators. The main question it aims to answer is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether prehospital titrated oxygen strategy in patients with suspected&#xD;
           AECOPD will decrease 30-day mortality compared to patients receiving standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention will receive titrated oxygen - a mix of supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      and compressed atmospheric air as driver for inhaled bronchodilators to target SpO2 (oxygen&#xD;
      saturation) 88-92%. The intervention will be compared to standard treatment, using compressed&#xD;
      oxygen (100%) as driver for inhaled bronchodilators.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The trial will be single blinded. The patients will be blinded to treatment allocation. The EMTs (emergency medical technicians) or paramedics will not be blinded because of practical, ethical and security problems with carrying compressed gas without known content in an ambulance. As part of study informed and training, the EMT's and paramedics will be attentive to keep all AECOPD suspected patients blinded to the treatment allocated.</masking_description>

    <description>If the treating EMT or paramedic finds indications for inhaled bronchodilators, this will be done with compressed air 6-8 l/min. as the driver for the nebulizer. The patient will have a Bi-nasal EtCO2 (end-tidal carbon dioxide) meter placed under the nebulizer. This will measure the EtCO2 during the treatment and at the same time oxygen can be titrated through this to a target SpO2 of 88-92%. Repeated treatment will be at the discretion of the treating EMT or paramedic according to SOP (standard operating procedures).&#xD;
Following scenarios regarding SpO2 can occur during treatment:&#xD;
SpO2 &lt;88%: Supplemental oxygen via the EtCO2-meter up to 10 l/min, if higher oxygen levels are needed oxygen will be used as driver for the nebulizer. If the SpO2 remains under 88% additional oxygen can be added via the EtCO2-meter.&#xD;
SpO2 88-92%: No intervention.&#xD;
SpO2 &gt;92%: No intervention.&#xD;
If repeated treatment is not indicated the patient receives oxygen to SpO2 88-92% according SOP.</description>
