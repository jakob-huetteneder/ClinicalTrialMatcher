  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a personalized, web-based training intervention&#xD;
      that was developed to teach use of an Electronic Memory and Management Aid (EMMA)&#xD;
      application. The app-based system is designed to support everyday memory, daily activity&#xD;
      management and positive health behavior engagement for older adults with subjective cognitive&#xD;
      complaints or mild cognitive impairment. The investigators will also evaluate the degree to&#xD;
      which a clinician is needed to oversee the uptake and utilization of the EMMA app during the&#xD;
      web-based training intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, &quot;Technical Support Only&quot; group&#xD;
      (T-only group) and &quot;Technical + Clinician Support&quot; group (T+C group). Participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who pass initial phone screening criteria will participate in a 2-3 hour&#xD;
      neurocognitive assessment over zoom to establish baseline cognition, prior to beginning the&#xD;
      intervention. Participants will also complete questionnaires and a real-world measure&#xD;
      assessing daily functioning. After the initial assessment is complete, participants will be&#xD;
      given one-month to learn to use the EMMA app by completing the self-paced intervention via&#xD;
      the adaptive, web-based training platform, which includes six lessons. EMMA device-use will&#xD;
      be captured throughout the study by the app itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A component of the self-paced, web-based intervention involves setting goals related to using&#xD;
      the EMMA app. A clinician will monitor the training data and goals the T+C group participants&#xD;
      make and conduct brief problem-solving and goal-refining sessions during the intervention&#xD;
      weeks. These sessions are expected to be 10-15 minutes. To keep training on track, the T-only&#xD;
      group will receive brief phone check-ins to monitor progression through the web-based&#xD;
      intervention. Following training, there will no longer be any differences in the treatment of&#xD;
      both groups, which will be monitored for an additional three months. Immediately following&#xD;
      training and at the end of the 3 month monitoring period, all participants will complete the&#xD;
      battery of questionnaires and answer a semi-structured phone interview. In addition, at the&#xD;
      end of the 3 month follow-up, all participants will again complete the neurocognitive&#xD;
      assessment and real-world measure of daily functioning.&#xD;
