  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the planned study, the effect of chess training on the cognitive abilities of children and&#xD;
      adolescents with psychiatric and psychosomatic illnesses will be investigated in a&#xD;
      naturalistic setting. Furthermore, the effects on therapy success and quality of life will be&#xD;
      determined.Despite the thoroughly positive results, CRT has not yet been included in the&#xD;
      official guidelines as an intervention in standard therapy; this is due, among other things,&#xD;
      to too few studies and too little knowledge in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry.&#xD;
      The planned study aims to fill the research gap in the field of chess training as an&#xD;
      adjunctive intervention in children and adolescents and to provide further evidence on the&#xD;
      relevance of CRT in child and adolescent psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of the proposed study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. chess training as a six-week add-on intervention will improve cognitive functioning in&#xD;
           adolescents with psychiatric/psychosomatic disorders compared to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. chess training as a six-week add-on intervention improves quality of life in adolescents&#xD;
           with psychiatric/psychosomatic disorders compared to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. chess training as a six-week add-on intervention positively influences the course of&#xD;
           therapy in adolescents with psychiatric/psychosomatic illnesses compared to standard&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
