  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To assess the prognostic role of Handheld Vital Microscopy (HVM) and evaluate levels&#xD;
      of endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) breakdown in patients demonstrating Hemodynamic Incoherence&#xD;
      (HI), to elucidate a mechanistic link between the eGC and HI in order to inform prognostic&#xD;
      enrichment of future resuscitation trials. We will serially evaluate MiH and the perfused&#xD;
      boundary region (PBR, an visual proxy for eGC thickness) using HVM, and a validated&#xD;
      circulating biomarker of eGC integrity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are few reliable prognostic indicators in early sepsis to predict disease progression,&#xD;
      in part because the pathophysiologic mechanism of vascular dysregulation remains incompletely&#xD;
      understood. The global COVID-19 pandemic has increased the number of patients with sepsis,&#xD;
      straining hospital systems and illustrating the need for research into prognostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies.1 An important area of research is the role of the eGC, a thin&#xD;
      vascular lining composed of proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycan side-chains, and plasma proteins&#xD;
      that play a central role in microvascular homeostasis, the function of which is compromised&#xD;
      in sepsis.2, 3 Another growing field of inquiry is the phenomenon of HI, a condition in which&#xD;
      MiH remain dysfunctional despite normalization of conventionally targeted MaH measures such&#xD;
      as mean arterial pressure (MAP), leading to poor end-organ perfusion.4, 5 It has been&#xD;
      hypothesized that HI due to persistently deranged MiH and reduced end-organ perfusion result&#xD;
      in an ongoing state of &quot;microvascular shock&quot;, leading to worsening end-organ damage despite&#xD;
      apparent normalization of conventionally targeted parameters.5 Importantly, HI has been shown&#xD;
      to predict poor patient outcomes, with abnormal MiH predicting patient mortality despite&#xD;
      normalization of MAP after administration of vasoactive medications.4, 6 MiH measures have&#xD;
      also been shown to differ significantly between septic patients and healthy controls.2 In one&#xD;
      study of a large sepsis cohort, MiH parameters were predictive of adverse outcomes, while MaH&#xD;
      parameters were not, suggesting that MiH measurements, and HI in particular may be more&#xD;
      sensitive than conventional measures for predicting outcomes in sepsis.7 One hypothesis is&#xD;
      that HI in sepsis is mediated by degradation of the eGC, with subsequent loss of&#xD;
      microvascular homeostasis, though the role of the eGC as a vascular barrier remains&#xD;
      controversial.8&#xD;
&#xD;
      One question that remains is whether or not microvascular changes can predict patient&#xD;
      outcomes in patients judged to be adequately fluid resuscitated, as measured by MAP or NICOM&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
