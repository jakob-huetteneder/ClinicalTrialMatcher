  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biologics such as risankizumab are currently the most effective treatment option for patients&#xD;
      with moderate to severe psoriasis. But they are costly for healthcare systems and still&#xD;
      described according to a 'one dose fits all' dosing regimen, leading to potential over-and&#xD;
      undertreatment. In this study the investigators aim to investigate the predictive value of&#xD;
      early serum trough levels of risankizumab and determine the therapeutic window of&#xD;
      risankizumab in psoriasis patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be included after signing informed consent. After inclusion, patients will&#xD;
      continue on standard dosing schedule of risankizumab (i.e. subcutaneous injections at weeks 0&#xD;
      and 4, then every 12 weeks (2x 75mg)). During each study visit blood will be taken in order&#xD;
      to quantify Ctroughs and/or anti-drug antibodies towards risankizumab. In addition, Psoriasis&#xD;
      Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score will be&#xD;
      evaluated by a physician. Patients complete the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and&#xD;
      European quality of life EQ-5D instrument at each visit.&#xD;

    <measure>DLQI</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 until week 52 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) (range 0-30) is a dermatology specific quality of life (QoL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on participant's QoL. It is a ten item questionnaire that, in addition to evaluated overall QoL, can be used to assess six different aspects that may affect QoL: 1) symptoms and feelings, 2) daily activities, 3) leasure, 4) work or school performances, 5) personal relationships, and 6) treatment.&#xD;
The scoring of each question is as follows:&#xD;
Very much - scored 3; A lot - scored 2; A little - scored 1; Not at all - scored 0; Not relevant - scored 0; Question 7, 'prevented work or studying' - scored 3. The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 until week 52 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems.The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits of the five dimensions can be combined into a 5- digit number that describes the patients' health state.</description>

    <description>The EQ VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) (range 0-10) records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>
