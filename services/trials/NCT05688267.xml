    <textblock>
      Background: The exercise intervention can help participants with prolonged mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation improve ventilator weaning; however, the content of exercise intervention is&#xD;
      diverse and inconsistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study aims to design the continuous mobility training and examine the&#xD;
      clinical effects in participants with prolonged mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This prospective, single-center, concealed allocation, evaluator-blind, randomized&#xD;
      control study divided participants transferred from the intensive care unit to the&#xD;
      respiratory care center into two groups. The control group underwent the routine ventilator&#xD;
      weaning plan and hand bicycle training, while the experimental group underwent routine&#xD;
      ventilator weaning plan and continuous mobility training plan. The success rate of ventilator&#xD;
      weaning, length of mechanical ventilation, length of stay at the respiratory care center, and&#xD;
      total length of hospital stay were analyzed.&#xD;

      The investigators designed a prospective, single-center, concealed allocation,&#xD;
      evaluator-blind, intention-to-treat, randomized control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants This study was at the respiratory care center of a hospital in Taiwan.&#xD;
      Individuals over 18 years of age, who used mechanical ventilation, were transferred from the&#xD;
      intensive care unit to the respiratory care center for mechanical ventilation weaning, and&#xD;
      were evaluated by a physician enrolled in the study. When a patient was eligible, the&#xD;
      physician would conduct further examinations to ensure the suitability and safety of the&#xD;
      participants, and the reasons for ineligibility for inclusion would be noted in the log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aged over 18 years, regardless of sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use of mechanical ventilation and transfer from the intensive care unit to the&#xD;
           respiratory care center for weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stable vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ability to understand simple instructions and agree to participate in this research&#xD;
           program after explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unconsciousness, severe cognitive impairment, or inability to follow instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Severe heart failure (NYHA â‰¥ 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diagnosis of terminal illness and undergoing palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inability to receive exercise therapy due to physical conditions, fracture, lower limb&#xD;
           surgery, acute thrombosis, open wounds, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assessment by other attending physician that the participant's condition, progression of&#xD;
           disease course or treatment plan were not suitable for exercise therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the participants enrolled in the research, the trained research team members would&#xD;
      explain the objectives and methods of the research to ensure that the participants' consent&#xD;
      was fully informed. The participants had the right to withdraw from this research program at&#xD;
      any time. If a participant was unwilling to participate or withdrew, they were excluded from&#xD;
      this research program. A participant could only be enrolled after agreeing and signing the&#xD;
      consent form. A randomized clinical trial design was adopted in this study. The participants&#xD;
      were randomly divided into the experimental and control group in a one-to-one ratio. The&#xD;
      research assistant placed the number plate in an opaque and sealed envelope to ensure&#xD;
      concealed allocation. The order of allocation was randomized by the computer. The control&#xD;
      group underwent the routine mechanical ventilation weaning plan and hand bicycle training,&#xD;
      while the experimental group underwent the routine mechanical ventilation weaning plan and&#xD;
      continuous mobility training. Owing to the nature of the exercise intervention, it is&#xD;
      impossible to maintain blinding of the team members and participants. However, the physical&#xD;
      therapists who evaluated the main outcome were separated from those who performed the&#xD;
      therapy; thus, the evaluators were blinded. The content of the continuous mobility training&#xD;
      program depended on the evaluation results and the physical responses of the participants.&#xD;
      The treatment frequency of continuous mobility training was five times a week, once a day&#xD;
      from Monday to Friday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention content Control group: Participants of control group formed the routine care&#xD;
      group, received the routine mechanical ventilation weaning plan and underwent hand bicycle&#xD;
      training. The physicians assessed the participants and appropriately adjusted the settings of&#xD;
      the mechanical ventilation modules to gradually reduce the participants' dependence on&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. Hand bicycle training was conducted by nurse practitioners once a&#xD;
      day. The participants' bedhead was raised, and the participants held the cycle ergometer with&#xD;
      both hands once they could tolerate upright positions for 15-20 minutes. Training intensity&#xD;
      was targeted at the level of symptom limitation, on the basis of a modified Borg scale rating&#xD;
      of 3-5. Intermittent and short-term periods of rest were allowed for participants to achieve&#xD;
      the goal of a total of 15-20 minutes exercise session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group: Participants of the experimental group were given continuous mobility&#xD;
      training in addition to the routine mechanical ventilation weaning plan. The protocol was&#xD;
      divided into 5 levels - a modification from Dong et al. The physicians were responsible for&#xD;
      evaluating whether the participants had any contraindications before and during enrolment. If&#xD;
      any contraindication occurred at any time point, such as hypoxemia and other adverse events,&#xD;
      the treatment would be terminated immediately. The continuous mobility training would be&#xD;
      performed once a day from Monday to Friday. During the whole continuous mobility training&#xD;
      process, the exercise progress would be increased gradually, depending on the tolerance and&#xD;
      stability of the participants. The goal setting of each training exercise was that the&#xD;
      participants could undergo the training for 20 minutes continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous mobility training adopted grading exercise level, which was evaluated and&#xD;
      implemented by physical therapists, and focused on continuous mobility training courses with&#xD;
      different levels. At each stage, the participants were instructed to perform spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing exercise, which were confirmed by the physical therapists. In the first stage, the&#xD;
      participants' bedhead were raised, and the trunk were kept upright on the bed. In sitting&#xD;
      posture training, chest expansion training and deep breathing training was performed. The&#xD;
      training goal was that the participants should be able to sit in bed for at least 20 minutes,&#xD;
      and after training, the modified Borg scale rating of the participants should not exceed 7.&#xD;
      If the participants could successfully complete the first stage of the exercise training,&#xD;
      they would proceed to the next stage of exercise, and the training would be further upgraded&#xD;
      to assisting the participants to sit at the bedside in an upright posture and perform sitting&#xD;
      balance training. The physical therapists would provide minimal assistance or assistive&#xD;
      devices according to the participants' conditions. The goal was to achieve tolerance for 20&#xD;
      minutes continuously with a modified RPE not exceeding 7 and no contraindications. In the&#xD;
      third stage, the physical therapists would adopt appropriate strategies and assistive devices&#xD;
      according to the participants' abilities and move the participants to chairs. The fourth&#xD;
      stage was standing training. The participants could use assistive devices or other assistance&#xD;
      to stand. The fifth stage was marching on spot. All exercise training was guided by the&#xD;
      principle of maximum active participation of participants, with the goal of continuous&#xD;
      completion of body movements and spontaneous breathing movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Termination conditions of continuous mobility training: The training would be terminated&#xD;
      immediately if the participants had the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unstable vital signs: low blood oxygen concentration (SaO2 â‰¤ 90%) or shortness of breath&#xD;
           (total respiratory rate &gt; 35 beats/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe dizziness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Changes in consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assessment by attending physician that the participant's condition, progression of&#xD;
           disease course or treatment plan was not suitable for activities of exercise therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention, the length of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the&#xD;
      respiratory care center, the success rate of mechanical ventilation weaning (weaning for more&#xD;
      than 5 days), the total length of hospital stay and adverse events of two groups were&#xD;
      recorded with evaluator-blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis All participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The mean,&#xD;
      standard deviation, and percentage of the participants' variables were used for descriptive&#xD;
      statistics. Comparative analysis between the experimental group and the control group was&#xD;
      performed according to all the effect variables. If the continuous variables conformed to&#xD;
      normal distribution according to Shapiro-Wilk test, they were expressed as meanÂ±standard&#xD;
      deviation (meanÂ±SD); otherwise, they were expressed as median (interquartile range).&#xD;
      Categorical variables were expressed as percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation records of the two groups of participants were compared, and continuous&#xD;
      variables with normal distribution were compared by two sample independent t-test. When the&#xD;
      data were not normally distributed, Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the experimental&#xD;
      group with the control group. Chi-square test was used to evaluate the differences in the&#xD;
      categorical variables between the experimental group and the control group. To calculate the&#xD;
      sample size for duration of mechanical ventilation, the investigators based the design on&#xD;
      results found in Lai (2017) for a clinical trial. Considering a statistical power of 90% and&#xD;
      alpha error of 0.5, the investigators found that the number of subjects should be 9 per&#xD;
      group, totaling 18 participants. The statistical analysis software used was SPSS version&#xD;
      27.0, with 2-tailed p&lt;.05 indicating statistical significance.&#xD;
