    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, parallel group study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of VTX958 in participants with moderately to severely active&#xD;
      Crohn's Disease. Approximately 132 eligible patients will be randomized, and randomization&#xD;
      will be stratified by prior use of biologics for the treatment of CD (yes/no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a 30-day Screening Period, a 12-week double-blind Induction Treatment&#xD;
      Period, a 40-week double-blind Maintenance Treatment Period, an Open-Label Extension (OLE) of&#xD;
      up to 144 weeks, and a 30-day safety Follow-Up Period. The maximum duration of treatment will&#xD;
      be 36 months, including the Induction, Maintenance, and OLE Periods. For all participants, a&#xD;
      Follow-Up visit will be performed at 30 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Evaluate the efficacy of VTX958 in achieving reduction in Crohn's Disease Activity Index&#xD;
      (CDAI) score and endoscopic response at the end of the Induction Period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the efficacy of VTX958 in inducing clinical and symptomatic response and&#xD;
           remission at the end of the Induction Period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the efficacy of VTX958 in inducing endoscopic response and clinical remission&#xD;
           at the end of the Induction Period&#xD;

    <measure>Change in mean Crohn's disease Activity Index (CDAI) score from baseline to week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>During screening to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Mean CDAI (Crohn's disease Activity Index). CDAI is a weighted index comprising eight Crohn's Disease (CD)-related clinical and laboratory variables, to assess CD disease activity. Three of the variables, stool frequency, abdominal pain, and general well-being, are patient-reported measures recorded daily. The total CDAI score is calculated using the sum of each variable times the multiplier. The total score range of the CDAI is from 0 to 600.</description>

    <description>SES-CD is an endoscopic grading system is used to assess CD disease activity. The SES-CD assesses 4 endoscopic variables: the size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface, and presence of narrowing. Each variable score ranging from 0 to 3. The total SES-CD score is calculated using the sum of all parameter scores in 5 segments: terminal ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in mean simple endoscopic score in Crohn's disease SED-CD at 12 weeks. The SES-CD is an endoscopic grading system is used to assess CD disease activity. The SES-CD assesses 4 endoscopic variables: the size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface, and presence of narrowing. Each variable score ranging from 0 to 3. The total SES-CD score is calculated using the sum of all parameter scores in 5 segments: terminal ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of participants achieving clinical remission at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>During screening to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a CDAI score &lt; 150. CDAI is a weighted index comprising eight Crohn's Disease (CD)-related clinical and laboratory variables, to assess CD disease activity. Three of the variables, stool frequency, abdominal pain, and general well-being, are patient-reported measures recorded daily. The total CDAI score is calculated using the sum of each variable times the multiplier. The total score range of the CDAI is from 0 to 600.</description>

    <description>Proportion of participants achieving clinical response at Week 12. A clinical response is defined as ≥ 100 points reduction from baseline in CDAI score or CDAI score &lt; 150. CDAI is a weighted index comprising eight Crohn's Disease (CD)-related clinical and laboratory variables, to assess CD disease activity. Three of the variables, stool frequency, abdominal pain, and general well-being, are patient-reported measures recorded daily. The total CDAI score is calculated using the sum of each variable times the multiplier. The total score range of the CDAI is from 0 to 600.</description>
