    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study in Chinese patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory CD22-positive B-cell ALL. The objective of the study is to confirm the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, and PK of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL&#xD;
      from mainland China.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Hematologic Remission (Complete Remission [CR]/Complete Remission With Incomplete Hematologic Recovery [CRi]) per Investigator Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Day 16 to 28 of Cycles 1, 2 and 3, then every 1 to 2 cycles (or as clinically indicated) up to approximately 4 weeks (end of treatment [EoT]) from the last dose</time_frame>
    <description>CR was the disappearance of leukemia indicated by less than (&lt;) 5 percent (%) marrow blasts &amp; absence of peripheral blood leukemic blasts, with recovery of hematopoiesis defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to (≥)1000 per microliter (/μL) &amp; platelets ≥100,000/μL. C1 extramedullary disease status (i.e. complete disappearance of measurable &amp; non-measurable extramedullary disease with the following exceptions: for participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, all nodal masses greater than (&gt;) 1.5 centimeters (cm) in greatest transverse diameter (GTD) at baseline must have regressed to less than or equal to (≤) 1.5 cm in GTD; all nodal masses ≥1 cm &amp; ≤1.5 cm in GTD at baseline must have regressed to &lt;1 cm GTD or reduced by 75% in sum of products of greatest diameters, no new lesions, spleen &amp; other previously enlarged organs must have regressed in size &amp; must not be palpable) was required. CRi was defined as CR except ANC &lt;1000/μL &amp;/or platelets &lt;100,000/μL.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Remission (DoR) for Participants Who Achieved CR/CRi</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years from first dose</time_frame>
    <description>DoR was defined as time from date of first response in responders (CR/CRi per Investigator assessment) to date of PFS event (i.e., death, progressive disease [objective progression, relapse from CR/CRi or treatment discontinuation due to global deterioration of health status] or starting new induction therapy or post-therapy stem cell transplant [SCT] without achieving CR/CRi). Participants without a DoR event at a time of analysis will be censored at the date of last valid disease assessment including follow-up disease assessment。</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving MRD Negativity (Based on Central Laboratory Analysis) in Participants Achieving a CR/CRi</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 4 weeks (EoT) from last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>Bone marrow aspirate, collected at screening and for remission status and assessment of MRD. MRD will be assessed using NGS for rearranged IgH, IgK, and IgL receptor gene sequences at a central laboratory. MRD analysis will be done at least once in patients with prior assessment of CR or CRi. MRD-negativity will be defined as malignant B lymphocytes occurring at a frequency of &lt;10^-4.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years from first dose</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as time from date of randomization to earliest date of the following events: death, progressive disease (objective progression, relapse from CR/CRi or treatment discontinuation due to global deterioration of health status) and starting new induction therapy or post-therapy SCT without achieving CR/CRi. Participants without a PFS event at time of analysis were censored at the last valid disease assessment. In addition, participants with documentation of an event after an unacceptably long interval (&gt;28 weeks if there was post-baseline disease assessment, or &gt;12 weeks if there was no post-baseline assessment) since the previous disease assessment were censored at the time of the previous assessment (date of randomization if no post-baseline assessment). Post-study treatment follow-up disease assessments was included. Kaplan-Meier method used and 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated based on the Brookmeyer and Crowley method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years from first dose</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from first dose to date of death due to any cause. Participants last known to be alive were censored at date of last contact.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Had a Hematopoietic Stem-Cell Transplant (HSCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years from first dose</time_frame>
    <description>HSCT rate is defined as the percentage of participants who proceed to HSCT among participants who take at least one dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years from first dose</time_frame>
    <description>Type and severity (including severity per National Cancer Institutes [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 5.0), including Veno-Occlusive Liver Disease (VOD)/Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS) (total, during study treatment, and post-HSCT)</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years from first dose</time_frame>
    <description>Type and severity (including severity per National Cancer Institutes [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 5.0)</description>

    <measure>Maximum Observed Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Serum Concentration (Cmax) Following Single and Multiple Dosing</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1, 4, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 2 and Day 1 of Cycle 4</time_frame>
