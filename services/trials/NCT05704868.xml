  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot randomised controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      UniVRse VR-CBT programme in first-generation students with social anxiety. The aims of this&#xD;
      trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether a full trial is justified;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish the effect size on the co-primary outcomes for a sample size calculation&#xD;
           for a definitive trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To address questions concerning study recruitment, retention, and acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a baseline assessment (T0) and then be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      receive either UniVRse VR-CBT or join the wait-list control group. UniVRse VR-CBT uses graded&#xD;
      exposure techniques delivered using VR to help first-generation students feel more confident&#xD;
      in university-based situations. Data will be collected post-intervention (T1) along with exit&#xD;
      interviews to assess participant experience.&#xD;

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>UniVRse + TAU</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>UniVRse is a Virtual Reality (VR) intervention targeting social anxiety in First Generation Students (FGS) using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques - specifically graded exposure. Participants will have access to UniVRse for a month post-randomisation and it is recommended they complete 6 sessions each 30-minutes long over this period. Exposure to the intervention will be reached if participants complete 2 30-minute sessions. UniVRse is a self-help intervention meaning that participants can engage in the intervention independently. Participants will be supported to progress through the UniVRse programme by a virtual mentor called Sam that will take on the role traditionally undertaken by the 'therapist'. Sam's function will be to provide psychoeducation, provide instruction on how to use the VR kit and interact with the virtual environment, and provide support and encouragement. Participants will be able to complete the intervention either on campus or at home.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Waitlist + TAU</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>We will be using a wait list control group. The wait list control group will receive treatment as usual for the duration of the trial. Treatment as usual may include active monitoring, meetings with academic advisors, psychiatric medication, and/or support from an NHS mental health team. We will not withhold treatment from the control group, but prospective participants may not be eligible to take part if they have current or confirmed plans to receive a psychology therapy (see exclusion criteria). Once the trial has ended, the participants in the control arm will be the first to be offered UniVRse when it is taken up by university support services.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>UniVRse + TAU</intervention_name>
    <description>UniVRse uses well-established evidence-basedcognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques - specifically graded exposure - to reduce fear and worries about social situations.People work towards overcoming their anxiety in a step-by-step fashion, building up to the most feared situation. In the context of UniVRse, students will be presented with four university-based scenarios that our coproduction team identified as being the most anxiety-induing for FGS:&#xD;
Attending a lecture;&#xD;
Group work in a seminar;&#xD;
Delivering a presentation;&#xD;
Contributing to an online seminar.&#xD;
The UniVRse programme has been designed with our co-production team comprised of FGS with social anxiety, CBT therapists, and a VR design company.</description>
