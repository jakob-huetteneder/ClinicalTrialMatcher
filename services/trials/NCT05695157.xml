  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this single arm intervention study is to investigate the safety and performance&#xD;
      of a suturing device for closure of the midline incision after open abdominal surgery. The&#xD;
      study population consists of 38 patients selected for open abdominal procedures for malignant&#xD;
      and benign colorectal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question it aims to answer is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • If the device facilitates a Suture-Length to Wound-Length (SL/WL) ratio of 4:1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants laparotomy wound will be closed with the device at the end of the operation and&#xD;
      closure related data as closure time and SL/WL ratio will be calculated. The wound will be&#xD;
      assessed for infection during the postoperative stay and the chart will be reviewed for wound&#xD;
      dehiscence and wound infection.&#xD;
