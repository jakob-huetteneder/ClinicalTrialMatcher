  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a large, randomized, controlled clinical trial in a heterogeneous&#xD;
      population and is aimed at assessing as a primary objective whether the fasting-mimicking&#xD;
      diet alone or in combination with the longevity diet can modify the percentage of fat mass in&#xD;
      a cohort of subjects stratified by sex, age and body mass index. As secondary objectives,&#xD;
      will evaluate the effects of the fasting-mimicking diet alone or in combination with the&#xD;
      longevity diet on the general health conditions of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a public health point of view, the efficacy of a food intervention such as the longevity&#xD;
      diet and/or short periods of fasting-mimicking diet would represent proof of the results that&#xD;
      can be achieved by a realistics, feasible and inexpensive approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information obtained is relevant because the nutritional intervention will be undertaken&#xD;
      by people who live in their normal environment and who simply receive every day dietary&#xD;
      guidelines, and support and/or boxes containing a 5 day meal program to be consumed in lieu&#xD;
      of their normal diet once every 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label in adult subjects: arm 1 will include subjects randomized to&#xD;
      follow a Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) plan with a 5-day meal program once every two months&#xD;
      for a 6-month period (3 cycles); arm 2 will include subjects randomized to follow the FMD&#xD;
      plus a Longevity Diet (LD) program for a 6-month period (FMD+LD); arm 3 will include&#xD;
      randomized to the control group that will be recommended to continue their usual diet.&#xD;
      Participants belonging to the control arm will be given an opportunity to follow a 6-month LD&#xD;
      program starting at the end of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with BMI &gt;=25 kg/m2 and in the 30 to 65 year range will be identified in towns&#xD;
      within of a range of 20 km from Varapodio (province of Reggio Calabria, Southern Italy).The&#xD;
      confirmation of eligibility and subsequent consenting will be carried out at the screening&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will undergo 5 different visits (pre-screening visit, screening visit,&#xD;
      baseline visit (t0), and two follow-up visits (after 3 and 6 months from the baseline visit).&#xD;
      Participants belonging to the control arm who decide to follow an optional 6-month LD program&#xD;
      at the last follow-up visit (month 6), will receive two additional visits at month 9 and at&#xD;
      month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-screening phone call visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the pre-screening visit is to determine if a potential participant fits the&#xD;
      study's core inclusion criteria (age and BMI) and doesn't meet some of its permanent&#xD;
      exclusion criteria (e.g. morbidities, pregnancy, known allergies, etc.). Once a potential&#xD;
      participant is cleared through the pre-screening visit and confirms interest in&#xD;
      participating, he/she may proceed to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the screening visit is to confirm the volunteer's eligibility for study&#xD;
      participation. Participants who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be informed about&#xD;
      the research study before any procedure is performed. Participants must provide written&#xD;
      informed consent to the processing of personal data in an anonymous and aggregate form in&#xD;
      compliance with the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR)&#xD;
      and the relevant Italian laws implementing the GDPR, including the Legislative Decree&#xD;
      No.101/2018 of 10 August 2018 on the protection of privacy in relation to the processing of&#xD;
      personal data. Any collection, processing and disclosure of personal data, such as&#xD;
      participant health and medical information is subject to compliance with the aforementioned&#xD;
      personal data protection laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening will include measurement of height, weight, and vital signs, review of medical&#xD;
      history and current medications, assessment of sleep quality and disturbances and collection&#xD;
      of fasting blood. Participants will be then randomized into either one of the intervention&#xD;
      arms (FMD or FMD+LD) or in the control arm using a web-based randomization system that will&#xD;
      be controlled by the researchers of the Valter Longo Foundation in Milan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit (T0)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within a week from the screening visit, subjects in arm 1 and 2 (FMD or FMD+LD) will be given&#xD;
      the box of FMD together with ketone test strips to self-monitor urinary ketone bodies during&#xD;
      the FMD cycles. Subjects in arm 2 will be given informative material and instructions for the&#xD;
      LD. During the visit, staff will administer the questionnaire for assessing life style and&#xD;
      dietary habits. The baseline visit will also include body composition assessment using&#xD;
      Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), measurement of height, weight, and vital signs,&#xD;
      medical history, current medications and a collection of fasting blood. Blood testing&#xD;
      information will be also retried from the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A portion of subjects for each study group reporting a sleep problem on the basis of the&#xD;
      score obtained at the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire will also receive&#xD;
      an Oura Ring device for the continuous monitoring of sleep state and wakefulness. These three&#xD;
      study groups will be balanced for age, sex, BMI and for the score obtained at the PSQI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (after three months or 5-7 days after the second FMD cycle, T1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months from the randomization, subjects in the FMD and FMD+LD arms will be contacted&#xD;
      to receive the FMD boxes for the second and the third FMD cycles, respectively, together with&#xD;
      the ketone test strips to self-monitor urinary ketone bodies during the FMD cycles. Visit 2&#xD;
      will also include body composition assessment using BIA, measurement of height, weight, and&#xD;
      vital signs and to assess sleep quality and disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (after six months or 5-7 days after the third FMD cycle,T2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the clinical visit, staff will assess signs and symptoms of adverse events, review&#xD;
      compliance to the diet programs. Visit 3 will also include body composition assessment using&#xD;
      BIA, measurement of height, weight, and vital signs, medical history and current medications&#xD;
      and a collection of fasting blood for both hematological and genetic analyses as previously&#xD;
      described for the baseline visit. Only subjects who undergo home sleep monitoring at the&#xD;
      baseline visit will also receive an Oura Ring device for the continuous monitoring of sleep&#xD;
      state and wakefulness. After this period, study staff will assess sleep quality and&#xD;
      disturbances with the PSQI and will answer any questions from the subject. At this point,&#xD;
      subjects belonging to the control arm will be given an opportunity to follow a LD program for&#xD;
      a 6-month period (optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional visit at month 9 and 12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects belonging to the arm 3 who decide to follow an optional LD program for a 6-month&#xD;
      period after the end of the study at 6 months will meet with the study nutritionist during&#xD;
      the clinical visits at month 9 and month 12. Staff will review compliance to the LD program&#xD;
      and answer any questions by the subject.&#xD;

        Other Exclusion Criteria: Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any concurrent condition (including clinically significant abnormalities in medical&#xD;
             history, physical examination or laboratory evaluations) which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             PI, would preclude safe participation in this study or interfere with compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any sound medical, psychiatric and/or social reason which, in the opinion of the PI,&#xD;
             would preclude safe participation in this study or interfere with compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal laboratory findings including: abnormal blood counts (hematocrit &lt; 33% or &gt;&#xD;
             47%; WBC &lt; 3.0 or &gt; 12.0 x10^3/mm3; platelets &lt; 140 or &gt; 500 x 10^9/L); abnormal&#xD;
             kidney function test (creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL) or liver function test(s) (AST, ALT,&#xD;
             alkaline phosphatase) &gt; 1.5X the upper limit of normal; serum calcium &gt; 11 mg/dL);&#xD;
             serum K &lt; 3.5 mEq/L; Na &lt; 134 or &gt; 148 mmolL-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of Childbearing Potential Contraception: the effects of the study products on the&#xD;
        developing human fetus have not been studied extensively. For this reason, women of&#xD;
        childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
        of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
        participation. Females of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
        receiving study products. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
        participating in this study, she should inform study staff and her primary care physician&#xD;
        immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy: because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in pregnant&#xD;
        women during treatment with the study products, pregnant women are not eligible for study&#xD;
        participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Breast-feeding: Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
        nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the study products, breastfeeding&#xD;
        mothers are not eligible for study participation.&#xD;
