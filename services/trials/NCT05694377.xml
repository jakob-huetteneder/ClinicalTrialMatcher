  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Executive function play a key role in boosting human behavioural performance. Based on&#xD;
      scientific literature, it is still controversial whether electroencephalography-based&#xD;
      neurofeedback (EEG-NFB) represents an effective technique for enhancing healthy adults'&#xD;
      executive function. This study evaluates generalized effects of 3-week EEG-NFB training,&#xD;
      using self-regulation of the theta to beta wave ratio (TBR), on executive function in healthy&#xD;
      adults. The subjects are an uniform group of healthy young right-handed males divided into&#xD;
      two equal groups. The trained group (TR) performs 3-week EEG-NFB training (three sessions per&#xD;
      week) focused on a cognitive self-regulation of TBR (to achieve the lower TBR values as&#xD;
      beneficial cognitive effect), while the control group (CO) does not participate in the&#xD;
      EEG-NFB training. Cognitive function are rated before and after 3-week EEG-NFB training by&#xD;
      psychological tests: Trail Making Test (TMT, parts A and B) and the Stroop Test (ST, parts I&#xD;
      and II). This project is important for the future development of effective EEG-NFB protocols&#xD;
      to be used by healthy people to improve their behavioural performance.&#xD;

      2. MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. Subjects A total of 50 healthy male students will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups of 25 subjects each using a computerized randomization method. The trained group will&#xD;
      undergo 3 weeks of EEG-NFB training, whereas the control group will not undergo training.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for study participation will be lack of any neurological disorders and&#xD;
      motor or cognitive deficits, lack of neurological incident in the past, age between 20 to 25&#xD;
      years, male sex, and right-handedness (this inclusion criteria will be to avoid an influence&#xD;
      of lateralization and gender on psychological tests outcomes). The study was approved by the&#xD;
      ethic committee of the University School of Physical Education in Wroclaw and will be carried&#xD;
      out in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Experimental procedure TR and CO groups will be each tested twice in the same time&#xD;
      periods, i.e., before 3 weeks period of EEG-NFB training (PRE) and after the training period&#xD;
      (POST). During the PRE and POST experimental sessions, all subjects will undergo&#xD;
      psychological testing to evaluate executive function. PRE testing in the both groups will be&#xD;
      performed 1 to 4 days before the first day of EEG-NFB training period, whereas POST testing&#xD;
      will be performed 1 to 4 days after the last day of EEG-NFB training period to ensure that&#xD;
      the measurements will be not due to the effects of the last single training session in the TR&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Psychological assessment All subjects will undergo cognitive testing (TMT and ST), which&#xD;
      will be performed by an experienced researcher. There will be two parts to the TMT: TMT-A, in&#xD;
      which a subject connects numbers in sequential order; and TMT-B, in which the subject&#xD;
      alternates between numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.). The former is used to examine&#xD;
      cognitive processing speed, while the latter assesses executive function. The ST also&#xD;
      consists of two parts: ST-I, in which a subject reads a list of 40 words, which are names of&#xD;
      colours printed in the colour itself; and ST-II, where colour names are printed in an&#xD;
      incongruent colour and the subject is required to ignore the word and correctly name the ink&#xD;
      colour. The former is used as a measure of processing speed and the latter to test selective&#xD;
      attention and inhibition. The subjects will be provided with instructions prior to starting&#xD;
      the TMT and ST. In both ST tests parts subjects will have the same instruction as &quot;name the&#xD;
      colour of ink&quot;, and will not be informed in ST-I that all name/ink are matched. All tests&#xD;
      (both parts of TMT and ST) will be preceded by preparatory/training trials, a similar but&#xD;
      shorter version of main tests. Before starting each test, subjects will be instructed to&#xD;
      concentrate and to make use their maximal attention skills during testing session. In both&#xD;
      tests (TMT and ST), the time taken to complete the test will be used as the performance&#xD;
      measure, with a shorter time reflecting a better performance. The tests will be administered&#xD;
      in a quiet room with only one and always the same investigator present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. EEG-NFB training procedure The EEG-NFB training program will involve nine training&#xD;
      sessions (three times a week over a 3-week period) each lasting 30 min. EEG-NFB training will&#xD;
      be conducted with ProComp Infiniti Encoder and BioGraph Infiniti Software v.5.1.3. The&#xD;
      training protocol will be set to decrease the EEG TBR value. For the 12 training sessions,&#xD;
      all participants will be subjected the same EEG-NFB protocol at C3 (according to the 10-20&#xD;
      system), which is related to Brodmann area 4. This location is selected because the TMT and&#xD;
      ST used to quantify the EEG-NFB effect are also related to activity in this brain region. The&#xD;
      EEG-NFB training sessions consists of a 20-s baseline period (i.e., with no feedback), 30-min&#xD;
      feedback presentation, and another 20-s baseline period. Subjects will be seated in front of&#xD;
      a computer screen and animations will be used as feedback; the animation starts when the&#xD;
      subject is sufficiently focused for 20 s. Three 10-min animations (flying duck, roller&#xD;
      coaster ride, and moving ball) will be shown to the subject during each EEG-NFB training&#xD;
      session. The raw EEG signal, TBR value over time, EEG signal noise, and EEG theta and beta&#xD;
      wave amplitudes will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TBR values will be recorded and calculated for each training session for the TR group and&#xD;
      will be compared between the beginning of the first and beginning of the last EEG-NFB&#xD;
      training sessions, to determine whether the 3-week training lead to decrease of the TBR&#xD;
      value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5. Statistical analysis The Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to estimate the distribution of&#xD;
      psychological parameters. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test or Student's t-test will be used to&#xD;
      assess the statistical significance of differences for paired sample comparisons (i.e.,&#xD;
      between PRE and POST testing sessions). The Mann-Whitney test or Student's t-test will be&#xD;
      used for unpaired sample comparisons (i.e., between TR and CO groups). Magnitude/importance&#xD;
      of differences will be calculated using the Cohen effect size d value for results of the&#xD;
      psychological tests; a value of 0 indicates no effect, whereas values &gt; 0.2, &gt;0.6, and &gt; 0.8&#xD;
      indicates small, moderate, and large effects, respectively. P value â‰¤ 0.05 will be taken as&#xD;
      statistically significant for all analyses. All statistical analyses will be performed using&#xD;
      SPSS Statistics 22.0 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).&#xD;
