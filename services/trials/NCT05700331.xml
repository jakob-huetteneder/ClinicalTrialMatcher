    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore the effect of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) on the&#xD;
      clinical symptomatology in Chronic Widespread Pain (CWP), to assess the acceptability,&#xD;
      tolerability, and safety of FMT in patients with CWP, as well as explore the effect of FMT on&#xD;
      the gut microbiome diversity in CWP. The investigators hypothesize that fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation will reduce pain intensity in patients with CWP, is acceptable, safe, and&#xD;
      tolerable in patients with CWP, and will achieve change of gut microbiome diversity after FMT&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this proposed proof-of-concept pilot study, the investigators capitalize an establish&#xD;
      chronic pain cohort to explore the effect of FMT in improving the pain symptomology in&#xD;
      patients with CWP. This will be a 12-week single-arm prospective interventional study, all&#xD;
      study subjects will receive 3 FMT infusions (N =20).&#xD;

    <description>FMT performed at week 0, week-2 and week-4: FMT solution will be prepared using stool from a single donor or mixing of stool from multiple donors. Feces will be diluted with sterile saline (0.9%). This solution will be blended and strained with filter. The resulting supernatant will then be used directly as fresh FMT solution or stored as frozen FMT solution for future FMT.&#xD;
Procedures for Infusion: 100-200 ml of FMT solution or sterile saline will be infused over 2-3 minutes into the distal duodenum or jejunum via oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD). After infusion, subjects will be monitored for 1 hour before discharged.&#xD;

             score &gt; 15&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients have anxiety defined by having a Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7) score&#xD;
             &gt; 10&#xD;

          -  Patients have active infection at the time of inclusion&#xD;

          -  Current pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed current active malignancy or cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
