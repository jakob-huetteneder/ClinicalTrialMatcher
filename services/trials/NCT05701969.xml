  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesiology residency requires extended and overnight shifts, which may negatively impact&#xD;
      the quantity and quality of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have investigated the effect of night float shift work on anesthesiology&#xD;
      resident sleep and performance and demonstrated that total sleep quantity and time spent in&#xD;
      deep and REM sleep were significantly reduced during night float and did not return to&#xD;
      baseline after 3 nights of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which regulates the circadian rhythm&#xD;
      that governs sleep. Exogenous melatonin may be used as a sleep aid and is available over the&#xD;
      counter in the United States. Melatonin is effective in realigning the circadian rhythm&#xD;
      disorder caused by night shift work and increasing sleep duration; however, melatonin's&#xD;
      effect on improving sleep in resident trainees has not been investigated. The investigators&#xD;
      propose a prospective double-blinded randomized control trial to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      melatonin on sleep quantity and quality in resident physicians assigned to a night float&#xD;
      system.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Residents in Post-Graduate Years 1-7 enrolled in residency programs with a night float system&#xD;
      (anesthesiology, general surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, general medicine, and&#xD;
      pediatrics) will be invited to participate in the study. A clinical study coordinator will&#xD;
      assist in obtaining informed consent. After informed consent is obtained, participants will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive either 3 mg melatonin or a matching placebo control. Medications&#xD;
      will be prepared and randomization performed by the UVA Pharmacy. Both participants and study&#xD;
      coordinators will be blinded to the treatment group. Participants will be provided with a&#xD;
      12-day supply of medication at the start of the night float week. They will be instructed to&#xD;
      take one capsule at least 20 minutes prior to going to bed at night or during the day after&#xD;
      completing their night float shift. Subjects will be given a portable EEG monitor (ZMachineÂ©&#xD;
      Insight+ monitor (General Sleep Corporation, Euclid, OH))12 and will be shown how to apply&#xD;
      the machine, monitor its functionality, and troubleshoot minor issues. They will be asked to&#xD;
      wear the device for 2-3 nights of baseline sleep, 5-6 days of sleep during night float, and&#xD;
      3-4 nights of recovery following night float, for a total of 12 consecutive days. Baseline&#xD;
      sleep data will serve as a control for each subject. EEG data collected will include: Light&#xD;
      Sleep, Deep Sleep, REM, Arousals, Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency, Latency to Persistent&#xD;
      Sleep, Wake After Sleep Onset, Total Deep Sleep, Total REM Sleep, and Time Out of Bed. Data&#xD;
      from two different night float periods separated by at least 2 weeks will be collected&#xD;
      (one-week melatonin and one-week placebo in random order). Residents will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete a daily questionnaire assessing daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and&#xD;
      the use of caffeine or other stimulants.&#xD;
