  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single-arm, phase II study that will enroll multiple myeloma (MM)&#xD;
      patients with persistent bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD) post autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (ASCT) irrespective of the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-one study subjects will be enrolled at Froedtert Hospital and the Medical College of&#xD;
      Wisconsin Cancer Center. Enrolled subjects will receive a combination of isatuximab,&#xD;
      lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (IsaRD) for 12 28-day cycles. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to determine bone marrow (BM) MRD ≤1x10^5 negativity rate, as measured by the&#xD;
      clonoSEQ® next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay, at the end of 12 months of IsaRD treatment.&#xD;
      Other objectives will further assess efficacy, tolerability, and molecular response to the&#xD;
      IsaRD regimen.&#xD;
