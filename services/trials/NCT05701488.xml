      The goal of this research study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tremelimumab&#xD;
      and durvalumab with or without Selective Internal Yttrium-90 Radioembolization (SIRT) in&#xD;
      participants with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who will undergo liver surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Durvalumab (a type of immunotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tremelimumab (a type of immunotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selective Internal Yttrium-90 Radioembolization (SIRT) (a type of radiation microsphere&#xD;
           bead)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized research study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of tremelimumab and durvalumab with or without Selective Internal Yttrium-90&#xD;
      Radioembolization (SIRT) in participants with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who&#xD;
      will undergo liver surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into one of two treatment groups: Durvalumab + Tremelimumab&#xD;
      versus Durvalumab + Tremelimumab + SIRT. Randomization means that a participant is put into a&#xD;
      group by chance. Radioembolization is a combination of radiation therapy and a procedure&#xD;
      called embolization to treat cancer. SIRT blocks tumor blood supply by injecting radioactive&#xD;
      particles into the hepatic artery and delivers internal radiotherapy on the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Durvalumab as treatment for HCC&#xD;
      but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. FDA has not approved tremelimumab as a treatment option for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations, radiology scans of the liver, blood tests, electrocardiograms, and follow up&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study is expected to last about 18 months with long-term follow up for&#xD;
      a maximum of 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company, is supplying the study drugs, tremelimumab and&#xD;
      durvalumab. Sirtex Medical Inc., a medical device company, is supplying the Yttrium-90 resin&#xD;
      Microsphere beads.&#xD;

             function (Child A) and with either AJCC stage IA, IB, II, and IIIA or BCLC stage 0 or&#xD;
