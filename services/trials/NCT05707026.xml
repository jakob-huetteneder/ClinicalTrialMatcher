  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Athletic training and sports participation is to enhance athletic performance. Performance is&#xD;
      however multifactorial i.e., depending upon several parameters including warm-up practice,&#xD;
      training regimes and other interventions. Stretching techniques that focus on increasing&#xD;
      posterior shoulder soft tissue flexibility are commonly incorporated into prevention and&#xD;
      treatment programs for the overhead athletes. GIRD is usually managed by stretching and soft&#xD;
      tissue release of posterior shoulder capsule. Fascial manipulation is a manual therapy&#xD;
      technique used in the management of musculoskeletal disorders. This study aims to evaluate&#xD;
      the comparative effects of cross fiber fascial manipulation with stretching techniques in&#xD;
      overhead throwing athletes&#xD;

      This was a randomized clinical trial that was conducted at Pakistan sports board and Coaching&#xD;
      center, Lahore. Non probability convenient sampling technique was used to collect the data as&#xD;
      per inclusion criteria. 40 Participants of this study were randomly allocated into 2 Groups.&#xD;
      20 participants in each group. The group A received three sessions of fascial manipulation&#xD;
      for two weeks. Group B received three sessions of sleeper stretch in a side lying position in&#xD;
      90o abduction, elbow at 90o flexion and then performed shoulder IR and cross-body adduction&#xD;
      stretch in sitting position. Three sets of the each stretch positions were held for 30&#xD;
      seconds with a 1 minute break between sets. A universal goniometer was used to measure&#xD;
      internal rotation, external rotation, horizontal abduction, ROWE score to assess function,&#xD;
      pain, stability and motion, Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) was used to assess pain. The&#xD;
      data was analyzed via SPSS version 22.&#xD;
