  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last four years alone, residents of Puerto Rico have experienced a slew of natural&#xD;
      disasters including Hurricane Maria in 2017, earthquakes in 2019 and 2020, the continued&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic from 2020-2022, and most recently Hurricane Fiona. This series of&#xD;
      distressing events can lead to an increased need for mental health resources and trauma&#xD;
      treatment. Furthermore, the unique single-district structure of the Puerto Rican education&#xD;
      system allows for the efficient dissemination of potential interventions and treatment to all&#xD;
      students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine two treatment conditions for educators and&#xD;
      school-aged children in Puerto Rico experiencing burnout, fatigue, and high stress: delivery&#xD;
      of a mindfulness-based educator curriculum and, for children who report Post Traumatic Stress&#xD;
      Disorder (PTSD) symptomatology, delivery of the mindfulness curriculum with the additional&#xD;
      intervention of Cue-Centered Therapy (CCT). The study has two aims: 1) To assess the efficacy&#xD;
      of the mindfulness curriculum and of CCT in a population of students, counselors, and&#xD;
      teachers, characterized by high stress over the last few years of natural disasters and&#xD;
      pandemic challenges and 2) To identify genetic contributions to resilience by analyzing gene&#xD;
      expression in students before and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goals of the investigators' research collaboration are to improve educators'&#xD;
      psychological well-being and children's socioemotional development when faced with high&#xD;
      stress and adversity and to improve mental health clinicians' competence and confidence in&#xD;
      treating children exposed to trauma by training them in CCT. The investigators' research will&#xD;
      identify critical biopsychosocial components responsible for the cognitive, behavioral, and&#xD;
      emotional improvement and effective implementation strategies in a large but geographically&#xD;
      dispersed school district. The knowledge base that will result from this study will inform&#xD;
      the implementation of trauma-informed care in school settings and with populations&#xD;
      experiencing stress and adversity, and contribute to the investigators' understanding of the&#xD;
      underlying biology of these interventions to provide a rationale for further development and&#xD;
      dissemination.&#xD;
