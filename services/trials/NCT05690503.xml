  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV2 (PASC), colloquially known as &quot;long-COVID,&quot; is thought to&#xD;
      affect between 10-30% of all COVID-19 survivors. Patients with PASC also report worsening&#xD;
      behavioral health symptoms over time that include new-onset depression, anxiety, and even&#xD;
      suicidal behavior. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial is to test&#xD;
      the efficacy of a glutamate modulator among PASC patients suffering from new-onset or&#xD;
      worsening of depressive symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While PASC symptoms have been identified in nearly every organ system, the most common&#xD;
      symptoms include fatigue, cognitive and attention deficits (known as 'brain fog'), shortness&#xD;
      of breath, and post-exertional malaise. New-onset depression, anxiety, and even suicidal&#xD;
      behavior have also been reported. Symptoms of PASC can exhibit daily variation; additionally&#xD;
      PASC frequently demonstrates a relapsing and remitting course. This is mitigated by cognitive&#xD;
      and emotional stress, physical exertion, diet, and alcohol consumption; therefore, measuring&#xD;
      treatment response and the course of illness over time can be challenging. While there are&#xD;
      many ongoing trials evaluating a variety of treatments for PASC, no clear treatment has&#xD;
      emerged; additionally, there are no published data on psychotropic medications alleviating&#xD;
      the inflammatory response and psychiatric symptoms in PASC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alterations in the transmission between neurons of a neurotransmitter called glutamate are an&#xD;
      important target of pharmacotherapy for PASC. Glutamate modulators have demonstrated promise&#xD;
      in improving depressive symptoms and suicidality and can improve cognitive functioning among&#xD;
      patients with these symptoms. The study team has recently developed a novel design that&#xD;
      integrates a clinical trial involving serial infusions. The current trial will evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of a sub-anesthetic infusion on individuals with PASC and depressive symptoms who&#xD;
      complete a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study conducted over 5 weeks&#xD;
      using a cross-over and counterbalanced design.&#xD;
