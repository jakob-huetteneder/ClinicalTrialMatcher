  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to learn about the safety, extent of the side effects&#xD;
      (reaction to vaccine), and immune response (your immune system's reaction) of the study&#xD;
      vaccine called Varicella Zoster Virus modRNA (VZV modRNA). We are seeking for healthy&#xD;
      participants who are between 50 and 69 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in 2 substudies: Substudy A (Phase 1) and Substudy B (Phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This substudy is the Phase 1 portion of the study. In this substudy, participants will&#xD;
      receive 1 of 3 VZV modRNA vaccine candidates (different construct, different dose levels and&#xD;
      different formulation [frozen or freeze dry powder]) or the approved shingles vaccine&#xD;
      intramuscularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned in 1 of 9 groups in the study and will receive 2 doses of&#xD;
      vaccine at different intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take part in this study for 8 to 12 months depending on the group they are&#xD;
      assigned to. Some group(s) will continue into persistence-of-immunity (overtime assessment of&#xD;
      effect of vaccine) portion of the study. Those participants assigned to these selected groups&#xD;
      will be involved in the study for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This substudy is the Phase 2 portion of the study. In this part of the study, participants&#xD;
      will receive either VZV modRNA vaccine at selected dose level/schedule/formulation or&#xD;
      approved shingles vaccine. This selection will be determined from Substudy A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be involved in this study for up to 5 years.&#xD;
