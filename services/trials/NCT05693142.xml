  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RGX-202 is a gene therapy designed to deliver a transgene for a novel microdystrophin that&#xD;
      includes functional elements of naturally-occurring dystrophin including the C-Terminal (CT)&#xD;
      domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, open-label dose evaluation clinical study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and clinical efficacy of a one-time intravenous (IV) dose of RGX-202 in&#xD;
      participants with Duchenne.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Duchenne) is a rare genetic disorder, caused by mutations in the&#xD;
      gene responsible for making dystrophin, a protein of central importance for muscle cell&#xD;
      structure and function. The absence of functional dystrophin protein in individuals with&#xD;
      Duchenne results in cell damage during muscle contraction leading to cell death,&#xD;
      inflammation, and fibrosis in muscle tissues, and ultimately progressive muscle weakness.&#xD;
      RGX-202 is designed to use the AAV8 vector to deliver a transgene to muscle cells that&#xD;
      encodes a novel microdystrophin that includes the functional elements of naturally occurring&#xD;
      dystrophin including the C-Terminal (CT) domain. This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter,&#xD;
      open-label, dose evaluation clinical study to assess the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (microdystrophin protein levels), pharmacokinetics, and preliminary clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of RGX-202 in 2 dose groups over 52 weeks when administered by one-time intravenous&#xD;
      infusion (IV) in ambulatory male pediatric participants with Duchenne.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six ambulatory, pediatric participants (ages 4-11 years old) with Duchenne are expected to&#xD;
      enroll in two dose groups, with doses of 1x10^14 genome copies (GC)/kg body weight (n=3) and&#xD;
      2x10^14 GC/kg body weight (n=3). The first 3 participants in each dose group will be dosed in&#xD;
      staggered fashion, at least 4 weeks apart, following increasing body weight: ≤20kg, ≤30kg and&#xD;
      ≤40kg. After an independent safety data review for each dose group, an expansion phase of the&#xD;
      trial may allow for up to six additional participants to be enrolled at each dose (for a&#xD;
      total of up to nine participants in each dose group). A total of up to 18 participants may be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive, short-term, prophylactic immunosuppression regimen will be administered&#xD;
      during treatment to mitigate a potential immune response.&#xD;
