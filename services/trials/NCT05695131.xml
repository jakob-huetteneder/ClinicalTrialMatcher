  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Factors related to successful rehabilitation are often directly related to adherence; for&#xD;
      instance, dosage, frequency, and intensity can burden the patient regarding time and&#xD;
      motivational factors. Furthermore, surrounding salience, patients may lose interest or find&#xD;
      an intervention boring after a few sessions. It is well documented that nonadherence not only&#xD;
      impacts rehabilitation for the patient but can also further prolong treatment, and increase&#xD;
      hospital and clinician costs, in addition to a higher prevalence of future comorbidities.&#xD;
      Therefore, strategies that improve patient adherence can significantly help optimize patient&#xD;
      care and treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One avenue to increase patient adherence is through the gamification of rehabilitation&#xD;
      therapies using virtual reality (VR). Gamification of rehabilitation therapy can make mass&#xD;
      practice required in rehabilitation therapies seemingly fun and more personally engaging for&#xD;
      the patient. Additionally, the immersive experience achieved through VR can further promote&#xD;
      salience and be customizable to individual patient requirements. As VR systems are now highly&#xD;
      portable and relatively simple to utilize, they can provide an excellent opportunity to&#xD;
      continue rehabilitation practice on the home front. Overall, the VR gamification of&#xD;
      rehabilitation may increase adherence by shifting patients' perspectives of therapy as&#xD;
      tedious, boring, or a hassle, to a fun and engaging game that ultimately helps their recovery&#xD;
      processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GlenXRose VR-delivered speech-language therapies (Cognitive Projections Lab, University&#xD;
      of Alberta) have been developed and piloted in collaboration with the Glenrose Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Hospital with the overall goal of increasing patient adherence, treatment outcomes, and&#xD;
      satisfaction with vocal therapy. The proposed studies are to investigate the feasibility of&#xD;
      implementing this technology in routine clinical care (specific to voice disorders),&#xD;
      obtaining clinician feedback, examining associated financial costs, and continuing to examine&#xD;
      the effect of the GlenXRose VR speech-language therapies on patient adherence and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, compared to traditional clinical care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonadherence to Speech-Language rehabilitation can result in suboptimal vocal recovery or&#xD;
      compensation methods while impacting the quality of life and further burdening the healthcare&#xD;
      system. In addition to traditional face-to-face voice therapy, many patients are further&#xD;
      given daily voice exercises to practice at home. It is estimated that 38-74% of patients are&#xD;
      nonadherent to voice therapies (Ebersole et al., 2018); with such a large prevalence,&#xD;
      opportunities to prevent and mitigate nonadherence to voice therapy can significantly promote&#xD;
      clinical/functional outcomes. In a recent meta-analysis, it is reported that methods&#xD;
      increasing adherence to speech-language rehabilitation further promote home practice&#xD;
      (Bartlett et al., 2022). One identified method of promise includes technological approaches&#xD;
      (Bartlett et al., 2022) such as the GlenXRose VR Speech-Language therapies (VR-SLP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose &amp; Objective: The GlenXRose VR-SLP program, developed by the Cognitive Projections lab&#xD;
      at the University of Alberta in collaboration with the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital,&#xD;
      provides patients with gamified vocal exercises, therapies, and education delivered through&#xD;
      immersive virtual reality. With the degree of VR portability, patients will be able to take&#xD;
      the equipment home to facilitate at-home vocal practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of these studies is to examine the feasibility of implementing the previously&#xD;
      developed GlenXRose VR Speech Language therapies (VR-SLP) to routine clinical care delivered&#xD;
      by Speech-Language Pathologists to patients with vocal cord disorders. The variables of&#xD;
      patient adherence to treatment as well as preliminary effects on vocal measurements (Voice&#xD;
      Handicapped Index - 10; Acoustic Analysis of Voice) will be explored.&#xD;
