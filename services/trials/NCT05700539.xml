  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disorder characterized by lack of&#xD;
      attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. It can have major impact on everyday life and&#xD;
      result in negative consequences for one's personal, academic, and work situation. For&#xD;
      individuals with symptoms of ADHD, increased levels of anxiety and depression are common, and&#xD;
      an overall reduction of quality of life is often present. This study protocol describes a&#xD;
      clinical trial of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT), using a randomized&#xD;
      controlled study design, with the primary aim to increase quality of life, as well as to&#xD;
      reduce symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, depression, and stress. A second aim is to investigate, by&#xD;
      qualitative means, what aspects of treatment were perceived as helpful and hindering when it&#xD;
      comes to completing iCBT. Two hundred participants with symptoms of ADHD will be included and&#xD;
      randomized to two conditions (treatment and wait-list control). The treatment period is&#xD;
      comprised of ten weeks, with two mandatory modules and ten modules from which the&#xD;
      participants can choose freely. Self-report measures are completed by the participants at&#xD;
      baseline and end of treatment, as well as at a six-month follow-up. The treatment is guided&#xD;
      by therapists and consists of weekly correspondence with the participants. The study will&#xD;
      utilize an intention to treat design, with ANOVAs and Reliable Change Index to evaluate&#xD;
      treatment effects. The qualitative part of the project will be interview-based and employ&#xD;
      thematic analysis. Lastly, a psychometric evaluation of a common instrument for determining&#xD;
      ADHD-symptoms will also be made. The results will hopefully contribute to the evidence base&#xD;
      for iCBT for individuals with symptoms of ADHD and help disseminate potentially effective&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

    <measure>Adult Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder Quality-of-Life scale (AAQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in quality of life from baseline to 10 week (i.e., post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The AAQoL (Brod et al., 2015; Brod, Johnston, Able, &amp; Swindle, 2006) is a disease-specific quality of life measure for adults with ADHD. The instrument measures quality of life-consequences of ADHD in four domains using and consists of 29 items. The instrument has excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .93 for the overall measure). One example of an item is &quot;In the last two weeks, how hard has it been for you to remember important things?&quot;, scored on a five-point Likert-like scale from &quot;Not at all/Never&quot; (1) to &quot;Extremely/Very Often&quot; (5). The scale ranges from 0 to 145.</description>

    <measure>Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-V1.1 (ASRS-V1.1) Symptoms Checklist (ASRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in ADHD symptoms from baseline to 10 week (i.e., post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The ASRS is an instrument that measures ADHD-symptoms (Kessler et al., 2005). The instrument consists of 18 items that correspond to the 18 symptom-criteria for ADHD found in the DSM-IV-TR (Association, 2000). Of these 18 questions, six have been identified as most predictive of ADHD-symptoms. The overall range of the entire measure is 0 to 72. However, there are separate items focusing on attention and hyperactivity.</description>

    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 Items (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in anxiety symptoms from baseline to 10 week (i.e., post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is an instrument that measures anxiety (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; Löwe, 2006). Its internal consistency is excellent (Cronbach's α = .92), and it has good test-retest reliability (IntraClass Correlation = .83; Spitzer et al., 2006). The instrument includes seven items and has a single-factor solution. The score ranges from 0 to 21 points and the items range from 0 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;Nearly every day&quot;; Spitzer et al., 2006). One example of an item is: &quot;Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems? Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Change in depressive symptoms from baseline to 10 week (i.e., post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a nine-item instrument measuring depression. It has excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .89) and a good test-retest correlation (r = .84; Kroenke et al., 2001). The instrument has a single-factor solution. The score ranges from 0 to 27 points (Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001). Items range from 0 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;Nearly every day&quot;). One example of an item is: &quot;Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems? Little interest or pleasure in doing things.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in stress symptoms from baseline to 10 week (i.e., post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS is an instrument that evaluates the subjective experience of general stress in various situations and is scored on a five-point Likert-scale 0-4 (&quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Very often&quot;), with seven items being scored in reverse (items 4-7, 9-10, and 13). The PSS includes 14 items in total and has been shown to have good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .84-.86) as well as good convergent and discriminant validity (Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983).</description>

    <measure>Negative Effects Questionnaire (NEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Incidence of negative effects of psychological treatment from baseline to post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The NEQ is a 32-item instrument that assesses unwanted and adverse events experienced by patients undergoing psychotherapy (Rozental, Kottorp, Boettcher, Andersson, &amp; Carlbring, 2016; Rozental et al., 2019), e.g., &quot;I experienced more unpleasant feelings&quot;. It is comprised of six factors: symptoms, quality, dependency, stigma, hopelessness, and failure. The internal consistency for the full instrument is excellent (Cronbach's α = .95), and is scored on several dimensions; 1) &quot;Did you experience this?&quot; (yes/no), 2) &quot;If yes - here is how negatively it affected me&quot;, from 0 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Extremely&quot;), and 3) &quot;Probably caused by&quot; (&quot;The treatment I received&quot; or &quot;Other circumstances&quot;).</description>
