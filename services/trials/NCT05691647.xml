  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based treatments for depression, such as antidepressive medication, usually have a&#xD;
      latency of 4 to 6 weeks before they achieve a therapeutic effect. Chronotherapy is a group of&#xD;
      non-pharmacological interventions that presumably act on the circadian system to achieve a&#xD;
      rapid-onset clinical effect and better long-term effects and has been shown efficient to&#xD;
      improve depressive symptoms. Interventions include sleep deprivation, sleep-phase advancement&#xD;
      and stabilization, and light therapy. There are few studies testing the effectiveness of&#xD;
      combining these three chronotherapeutic techniques in the initial phase of treatment of&#xD;
      depression in a secondary mental health care outpatient clinic. The investigators aim to test&#xD;
      the effects and safety of chronotherapy in addition to TAU compared to TAU alone, with the&#xD;
      primary outcome being self-reported depressive symptoms at 1 week following randomization.&#xD;
      The study is a randomized controlled trial with 76 patients with a depressive episode who&#xD;
      initiate outpatient treatment at Nidaros DPS, St. Olavs University Hospital. Participants&#xD;
      will be allocated 1:1 to either chronotherapy + treatment as usual (TAU) or to TAU alone.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Masking will not be applicable due to the nature of the study, in which participants randomized to receive chronotherapy plus treatment as usual will be admitted to the ward for a one-night sleep deprivation, and the participants and researchers will understand which intervention arm the participant is receiving. Researchers and participants will not be aware of randomization until after baseline-assessments are completed. Analyses will be conducted by a statistician who is blinded to intervention allocation.</masking_description>

The rMEQ has five items yielding scores from 4 to 25, with lower scores indicating &quot;eveningness&quot; and higher scores indicating &quot;morningness&quot;. Higher scores indicate higher levels of morningness. Scores can be divided into five categories: definitely evening type (score &lt;8), moderately evening type (Score 8-11), neither type (score 12-17), moderately evening type (score 18-21), and definitely morning type (score &gt;21).</description>

    <description>Chronotherapy involves three different interventions. Sleep deprivation/wake therapy will be conducted for 34 hours. To assist wake and to ensure that the participants adhere to the sleep deprivation, they will be admitted to a one-night stay at the inpatient ward that is connected to the outpatient clinic at Nidaros DPS. Upon discharge, participants are encouraged to adhere to the sleep schedule which presents the sleep-wake phase advancement and later stabilization of the sleep-wake phase. Light therapy is provided for half an hour every day from day four in the study. In addition to the chronotherapeutic interventions, the participants will receive treatment as usual (TAU) with their assigned therapist.</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to receive TAU alone, will receive standard treatment for a depressive episode in the outpatient clinic. This study will not give restrictions or guidelines on how this treatment should be performed. The TAU-group will receive the treatment the responsible therapist considers and evaluate best fitting in the situation. Typical interventions administered in therapy for a depressive episode includes medication, cognitive behavioral therapy, and other psychotherapies.</description>
