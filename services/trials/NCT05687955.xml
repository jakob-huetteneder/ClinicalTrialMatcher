  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip injuries are reported to account for 71% and 29% of all injuries reported in female and&#xD;
      male performers, respectively, at the National Institute of Circus Arts. There are no reports&#xD;
      on hip pathology in circus performers, nor are there any reported exercise interventions for&#xD;
      hip pain in circus performers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of an exercise rehabilitation program on patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      measures, hip strength and range of movement, and functional assessments in circus arts&#xD;
      students with clinically and radiologically diagnosed hip pain-related disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undertake a 12-week strength exercise protocol that has been specifically&#xD;
      designed to focus on hip rehabilitation appropriate for circus performance. Expected outcome:&#xD;
      Improvements in patient reported outcome measure (PROM) scores and an increase in function,&#xD;
      strength and hip range of movement in people with hip pain&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Hip Exercise Program</intervention_name>
    <description>The exercise intervention is being implemented 3 times per week. Two sessions can be completed at home by the participant, and one session per week will be attended by a physiotherapist that will monitor exercise technique and progress the exercise program for each participant. The exercise protocol has been specifically designed to focus on hip rehabilitation appropriate for circus performance. The exercise program will involve hip strength exercises in the sagittal, coronal and transverse planes using weights and elastic bands (Theraband). It will also include trunk strength and postural correction exercises to address swayback posture which is a common clinical presentation in those with hip dysplasia.</description>
