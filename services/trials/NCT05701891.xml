    <textblock>
      This study examines the effect of a 12-week intervention of physiotherapy with integrated&#xD;
      Virtual Reality (VR) on 120 patients with complex chronic low back pain. Patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group will receive physiotherapy with integrated VR, while patients in the&#xD;
      control group will receive physiotherapy as usual. The (cost-)effectiveness of this&#xD;
      intervention will be investigated at 3 months and 12 months follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Rationale: Physiotherapy, mainly consisting of exercise therapy and patient education, is a&#xD;
      first-choice primary care treatment for patients with chronic low back pain (LBP), but&#xD;
      unfortunately, especially patients with severe disability and pain demonstrate poor outcomes.&#xD;
      Therapeutic VR is considered a potential breakthrough for LBP patients in general and for our&#xD;
      complex group of patients with severe disability and pain in particular, as it specifically&#xD;
      targets the identified limitations of usual physiotherapy. Therefore, a personalised,&#xD;
      VR-integrated physiotherapy intervention, tailored to specific patient characteristics, is&#xD;
      expected to result in larger improvements in physical functioning and pain, and more&#xD;
      favourable cost-effectiveness, compared to usual physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective is to investigate whether a personalised, physiotherapy&#xD;
      intervention with integrated therapeutic virtual reality (VR) is (cost-)effective at 3 months&#xD;
      and 12 months follow-up, compared to usual physiotherapy, in a subgroup of patients with&#xD;
      complex chronic low back pain (LBP) and severe disability and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Cluster randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 120 chronic LBP patients with combination of severe disability and severe&#xD;
      pain, consulting a physiotherapist in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The experimental intervention will be a 12-week personalised, VR-integrated&#xD;
      physiotherapy intervention in which a selection of existing VR modules developed by research&#xD;
      partners (i.e. Reducept and SyncVR) will be integrated into physiotherapy based on the&#xD;
      recommendations of the LBP guidelines. The control intervention will be physiotherapy as&#xD;
      usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Physical functioning (primary outcome), in addition to pain&#xD;
      and a minimal set of other secondary clinical, adherence-related, psychological and economic&#xD;
      measures, at baseline and 1, 3 and 12 months follow-up.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a two-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial. Twenty physiotherapists with expertise in chronic LBP treatment will be recruited and equally randomised (10 in each arm) on the level of physiotherapy practice using allocation concealment. This clustered design means that eligible patients consulting a participating physiotherapist will be automatically allocated to the study arm (experimental or control arm) to which the physiotherapy practice was allocated.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Our intervention will be a 12-week personalised, VR-integrated physiotherapy intervention in which a selection of existing VR modules developed by our partners (i.e. Reducept and SyncVR) will be integrated into physiotherapy treatment. The following VR modules will be used: education (Reducept), relaxation and distraction (SyncVR Relax &amp; Distract), activation (SyncVR Fit). Patients will use the Pico Neo 3 VR headset at the physiotherapy practice and at home 5 days a week for 10-30 minutes. In addition, physiotherapists will help patients transition from movements performed in a VR context to daily activities without VR.</description>
