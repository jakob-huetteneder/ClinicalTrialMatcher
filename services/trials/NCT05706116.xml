  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Controlled Human Infection Model (CHIM) is being developed to provide early&#xD;
      proof-of-concept that experimental infection with the intestinal nematode, Trichuris&#xD;
      trichiura, is feasible and safe. The proposed model consists of enrolling consenting,&#xD;
      healthy, trichuriasis-na誰ve adults and challenging them with the investigational product,&#xD;
      Trichuris trichiura Egg Inoculum, to assess their ability to result in detectable infection.&#xD;
      The proposed study will be a feasibility study that will consist of administering different&#xD;
      doses of the Trichuris trichiura Egg Inoculum to healthy adult volunteers to determine the&#xD;
      optimal dose (i.e., number of T. trichiura eggs) that is safe, well-tolerated and results in&#xD;
      consistent infection.&#xD;

      Open-label, dose-escalation clinical study in healthy, trichuriasis-na誰ve adults:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  George Washington University, Washington, DC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,&#xD;
           National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of participants: up to 18 in 3 cohorts of 6 volunteers each&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 1, six (6) volunteers will receive an inoculum of 150 embryonated Trichuris&#xD;
      trichiura eggs. In Cohort 2, six (6) volunteers will receive an inoculum of 300 embryonated&#xD;
      Trichuris trichiura eggs. In the optional Cohort 3, six (6) volunteers will receive an&#xD;
      inoculum of 450 embryonated Trichuris trichiura eggs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohorts will be enrolled in a staggered fashion with safety data assessed prior to larval&#xD;
      dose escalation. Cohort 2 will be inoculated no earlier than 16 weeks after the last&#xD;
      volunteer is inoculated in Cohort 1. The optional Cohort 3 will be inoculated no sooner than&#xD;
      16 weeks after the last volunteer is inoculated in Cohort 2. Cohort 3 will be enrolled only&#xD;
      if the tolerability of the experimental infection of Cohort 2 is acceptable and does not&#xD;
      result in significant adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Egg administration schedule: Study Day 0 (single administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Route: oral&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doses of T. trichiura Egg Inoculum to be tested: 150, 300 and 450 embryonated eggs (high&#xD;
           dose optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study duration: approximately 10 months per study participant&#xD;

    <description>Trichuris trichiura Egg Inoculum that will be used in this study is manufactured by obtaining T. trichiura eggs from the feces of a chronically infected human volunteer, who is negative for HIV, HBV, and HCV. Fecal material is processed following a qualified standard procedure, and after isolating eggs, they are stored at 2-8oC until use. Controls for the manufacturing process are tests for viability (microscopy of larval hatching), species identification (PCR), and microbial bioburden of the eggs.</description>

&#xD;
         13. Other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the safety or&#xD;
             rights of a volunteer participating in the trial or would render the participant&#xD;
             unable to comply with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
