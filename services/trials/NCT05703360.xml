  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an immersive&#xD;
      virtual-reality (IVR) based stimulation program, in improving visual perception for people&#xD;
      who have lost their driver's license due to perceptual or cognitive impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can the 6-week IVR stimulation program help improve driving performance?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will participants experience improvement in visual detection and perception after&#xD;
           training?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be randomized into a waitlist group or intervention-first group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The VR-based intervention will consist of training every 2 days for six weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Waitlist group will wait 6 weeks before starting intervention at study midpoint (week 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention-first group will begin with intervention (week 1-6) and then stop&#xD;
           intervention at study midpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete tests related to driving performance, visual attention, and&#xD;
           visual fields at the start of study, midpoint, and end of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will analyze data for changes from baseline in outcome measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will be an interventional, cross-over, single blind, randomized,&#xD;
      supportive care, single-center study lasting 12 weeks with a target recruitment of 30&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING AND BASELINE TESTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be identified from patients receiving routine care at Toronto&#xD;
      Western Hospital by their ophthalmologist. After obtaining informed consent and screened for&#xD;
      inclusion, the research coordinator will set up appointments for each participant to complete&#xD;
      baseline tests related to driving performance, visual attention, and visual fields.&#xD;
      Participants will also practice the IVR program and be assessed for IVR sensitivity, or&#xD;
      cybersickness, using the Virtual-Reality Induced Symptoms and Effects (VRISE) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into a Waitlist group or Intervention-First group. The&#xD;
      Intervention-First group will be given a head-mounted display (HMD) to take home for&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION (Week 1 - 12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 1 (Week 1-6):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Waitlist Group has no intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention-First group trains at home every 2 days using HMD&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are booked for their second appointments to repeat baseline tests once&#xD;
      Period 1 is complete. Intervention-first group will return their HMD to the researchers and&#xD;
      Waitlist group will be given their HMD to take home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2 (Week 7-12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Waitlist Group trains at home every 2 days using HMD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention-First group has no intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are booked for their third appointments to repeat baseline tests once Period&#xD;
      2 is complete. Waitlist group will return their HMD to researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Period 1 (Waitlist Group vs Intervention-First Group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Waitlist Group (Period 1 vs Period 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intervention-First Group (Period 1 vs Period 2)&#xD;

    <description>The SSQ will be administered after each driving session to capture any feelings related to simulator sickness.&#xD;
The SSQ is a validated 16-item questionnaire that assesses various symptom categories of simulator sickness. Responses are made on a 4-point scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; (total score = 0) to &quot;severe&quot; (total score =235.62). A total score (TS) ≥ 150 corresponds to mild to severe symptoms. Three subscales within the SSQ specifically targeting feelings of nausea (SSQ-N), oculomotor disturbances (SSQ-O), and disorientation (SSQ-D) as well as a total score (SSQ-TS) can be calculated based on pre-defined factor weightings.</description>

Participants will complete the VRISE immediately after being trained on how to use the VR intervention at the initial visit.

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Audiovisual Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>The device application involves the 3D multiple-object-tracking (3D-MOT) paradigm composed of 8 high-contrast spheres which are adapted to the visual ability of participant (luminosity and size). The initial speed of the spheres is adjustable and determined during the inclusion visit.&#xD;
One or more of the spheres is temporarily highlighted (target). Then all 8 spheres move for 20 seconds following random linear paths, bouncing on one another and on the walls of a virtual 3D cube when collisions occur. After 20 seconds, the movement stops and the participant is asked to select, using the hand controller, the initially highlighted target(s) among the 8 spheres. If the selection is correct the speed of the spheres in the next trial is increased. If the selection is incorrect the speed of the spheres in the next trial is decreased.&#xD;
Based on performance, stimulations will be adjusted to change difficulty level (e.g. changing backgrounds, number of cued balls, etc.)</description>
