    <textblock>
      This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of sunitinib malate in&#xD;
      combination with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in treating patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumors. Sunitinib malate is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors and a form of&#xD;
      targeted therapy that blocks the action of abnormal proteins called VEGFRs that signal tumor&#xD;
      cells to multiply. This helps stop or slow the spread of tumor cells. Radioactive drugs, such&#xD;
      as lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal&#xD;
      cells. It is also a form of targeted therapy because it works by attaching itself to specific&#xD;
      molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as somatostatin receptors, so that&#xD;
      radiation can be delivered directly to the tumor cells and kill them. Giving sunitinib malate&#xD;
      and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in combination may be safer and more effective in treating&#xD;
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors than giving either drug alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of sunitinib&#xD;
      malate with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in metastatic unresectable pancreatic neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumors (NETS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To assess objective response rate (ORR) of&#xD;
      the combination by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the duration of response (DOR) from the combination. V. To determine&#xD;
      lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dosimetry in the combination. VI. To associate somatostatin receptor&#xD;
      (SSR) positron emission tomography (PET) triage imaging with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate&#xD;
      dosimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To assess the correlation of chromogranin A (CgA) with disease response in patients&#xD;
      being treated with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sunitinib malate followed by a dose-expansion&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      on study. Patients undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) throughout the trial. Patients also undergo a SSR PET/CT scan during screening and&#xD;
      blood sample collection on study.&#xD;

             initiation of the study protocol&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate and sunitinib malate on the developing human&#xD;
             fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because&#xD;
             radionucleotides and anti-angiogenic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation. All women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test prior to receiving sunitinib malate. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate and sunitinib&#xD;
             malate administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from acute clinically significant adverse events due&#xD;
             to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the&#xD;
             exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to sunitinib malate or lutetium Lu 177 dotatate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require use of therapeutic doses of coumarin-derivative anticoagulants&#xD;
             such as warfarin are excluded, although doses of up to 2 mg daily are permitted for&#xD;
             prophylaxis of thrombosis. Note: Low molecular weight heparin is permitted provided&#xD;
             the patient's prothrombin time (PT) international normalized ratio (INR) is =&lt; 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an&#xD;
             inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical&#xD;
             procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their&#xD;
             ability to swallow and retain sunitinib tablets are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any of the following conditions are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal&#xD;
                  abscess within 28 days of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack within&#xD;
                  12 months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, stable/unstable angina,&#xD;
                  symptomatic congestive heart failure, or coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft&#xD;
                  or stenting within 12 months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of pulmonary embolism within the past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association Class&#xD;
                  (NYHA) functional classification system&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors&#xD;
             within 7 days before dosing, or strong CYP3A4 inducers within 12 days before dosing,&#xD;
             are ineligible as sunitinib is a major substrate of CYP3A4. Because the lists of these&#xD;
             agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a&#xD;
             frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent&#xD;
             procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other&#xD;
             agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is&#xD;
             considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a pre-existing thyroid abnormality who are unable to maintain thyroid&#xD;
             function in the normal range with medication are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because sunitinib malate is an&#xD;
             anti-angiogenic agent and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is a peptide receptor radionuclide&#xD;
             therapy with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is&#xD;
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with sunitinib malate and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with sunitinib malate&#xD;
             and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Breastfeeding should be discontinued for 2.5 months&#xD;
             following the last lutetium Lu 177 dotatate treatment. These potential risks may also&#xD;
             apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior treatment with sunitinib malate or lutetium Lu 177&#xD;
             dotatate therapy or other radiopharmaceuticals (including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             metaiodobenzylguanidine [MIBG], yttrium-90 [Y-90], radioactive iodide [RAI]), as MIBG&#xD;
             and RAI could potentially increase risk of myelodysplastic syndrome or irreversible&#xD;
             hematologic toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% or less&#xD;
