  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to research if hydroxychloroquine can prevent chemotherapy induced&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy. Certain chemotherapy drugs, like paclitaxel, are known to cause&#xD;
      neuropathy which can impact quality of life. Currently, there are no options for preventing&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy. In addition, there are no useful methods to assess peripheral nerve&#xD;
      damage. This study will also explore using a study MRI of patients' feet prior to starting&#xD;
      chemotherapy and after they have completed chemotherapy to see if there is any difference in&#xD;
      their nerve structure.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is symptomatic CIPN defined as increase in in FACT-GOG/Ntx-12 questionnaire score of greater than or equal to 3 points post-chemotherapy with hydroxychloroquine in combination with paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer or gynecologic malignancies.</description>

    <measure>Predicting Symptomatic CIPN: FA and ADC values derived from DTI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline fractional anisotrophy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values derived from DTI will be used to predict symptomatic CIPN prior to starting and end of chemotherapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Predicting Symptomatic CIPN: change in FA and ADC</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mean FA and ADC prior to starting and end of chemotherapy will be calculated. The mean of the change in FA and ADC values with 95% confidence intervals will be estimated (post- minus pre- chemotherapy). The baseline values and the change of FA and ADC will be used to predict the development of symptomatic CIPN using logistic regression.</description>

    <measure>Predicting Symptomatic CIPN: baseline NF-L levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline level of neurofilament light chain (NF-L) will be used to predict symptomatic CIPN. The baseline values will be used to predict development of symptomatic CIPN using logistic regression.</description>

    <description>Changes in NF-L levels with chemotherapy used to predict development of symptomatic CIPN. NF-L measures will be summarized across time and analyzed using linear mixed effects model.</description>
