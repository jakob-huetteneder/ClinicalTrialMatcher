  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polysaccharide super paramagnetic ferric oxide injection is an iron supplement developed for&#xD;
      patients with iron deficiency anemia. Due to its characteristics, it has the potential to be&#xD;
      a contrast agent. The DJTCSCYHT-I-04 study is a single-center, multiple-strength and&#xD;
      single-dose phase I clinical study on cardiovascular MRI in patients with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease, aiming to investigate the effects and safety of multi-strength, single-dose at&#xD;
      different time points, and to provide reference for clinical diagnosis and MRI enhancement.&#xD;
