  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a high incidence reaching up to 45%; of severe intraoperative and postoperative pain&#xD;
      associated with arthroscopic shoulder surgery, which is often significant enough to interfere&#xD;
      with initial recovery and rehabilitation.Various peripheral nerve blocks have been used to&#xD;
      reduce intraoperative anesthetic requirements to improve rapid recovery and reduce&#xD;
      postoperative pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the Combined suprascapular nerve block and axillary nerve block (SSNB+ANB) was&#xD;
      proposed to provide anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for shoulder surgery as a safe&#xD;
      alternative to ISB.most of the nerve supply from C5 and C6 nerve roots are carried by&#xD;
      suprascapular and the axillary nerves. These two peripheral nerves are responsible for the&#xD;
      majority of the sensory innervation of the shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid that is commonly used to decrease the body's inflammatory&#xD;
      response. Doses of 1, 2, 4, and 8 mg have been used as an adjuvant in interscalene,&#xD;
      supraclavicular, ankle, and brachial plexus blocks . However, when dexamethasone is used as&#xD;
      an adjuvant in a PNB, the specific mechanism of action is unknown . Dexamethasone may produce&#xD;
      extended analgesia through vasoconstriction and reduced absorption of local anesthetic or&#xD;
      through &quot;direct action on the nerve cell to reduce neural discharge&quot; .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite having an unknown mechanism, a Cochrane review of 35 trials of 2702 participants&#xD;
      determined that perineural dexamethasone adjuvant increased sensory block 6.7 hours (95%&#xD;
      confidence interval) in comparison to a placebo . Similarly, intravenous dexamethasone&#xD;
      increased sensory block 6.2 hours in comparison Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective and&#xD;
      potent central alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. Administration of this adjuvant in&#xD;
      miscellaneous methods has received considerable attention in recent years. Due to its&#xD;
      analgesic and sedative effects, besides the lack of any respiratory-sparing effects,&#xD;
      administration of this adjuvant has been effective in reducing the need for opioids in the&#xD;
      perioperative period and may even result in cooperative sedation . Given the sympatholytic&#xD;
      effects of dexmedetomidine (hypotension and bradycardia), in addition to oversedation,&#xD;
      especially when administered intravenously or at high doses, caution must be taken in&#xD;
      administering this drug, especially in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neuraxial administration of dexmedetomidine has nociceptive effects on somatic and&#xD;
      visceral pains . It also reduces postoperative pain and prolongs analgesia, although there is&#xD;
      a risk of bradycardia. Various doses of dexmedetomidine, along with a number of analgesic&#xD;
      drugs, have been used in many studies. However, the exact dose of dexmedetomidine, as an&#xD;
      adjuvant drug administered along with other intravenous drugs in the perioperative period,&#xD;
      has been controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed mechanism for perineural dexmedetomidine in PNBs as first studied in rat models&#xD;
      is similar to that of clonidine, which relies not on alpha-2 agonism mechanism, but instead&#xD;
      blocks hyperpolarization-activated Ih cation currents and causes vasoconstriction for&#xD;
      prolonged analgesia . Perineural dexmedetomidine adjunct use is off-label, and proper&#xD;
      risk-benefit analysis, especially in patients where bradycardia and hypotension would be&#xD;
      concerning, would be necessary before even more widespread use of dexmedetomidine in PNBs can&#xD;
      be expected .&#xD;
