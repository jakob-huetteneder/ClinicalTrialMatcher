  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients hospitalized with tachypnea, defined as respiratory rate â‰¥20/ min, have substantial&#xD;
      mortality and may suffer from different conditions, including acute heart failure (HF).&#xD;
      Symptoms of HF can be difficult to identify and ~15% of patients with HF will not be&#xD;
      correctly diagnosed by the treating physician in the Emergency Department. Biomarkers like&#xD;
      B-type natriuretic peptides and cardiac troponins improve diagnostic accuracy and risk&#xD;
      stratification. Whether early, structured biomarker assessment and structured feedback in the&#xD;
      patient's electronic health records improve management and outcomes among unselected patients&#xD;
      with tachypnea have previously not been explored in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main research question of the study is to determine whether early structured biomarker&#xD;
      assessment in unselected patients with tachypnea extends the time to the first event for&#xD;
      either (1) all-cause readmission or (2) all-cause mortality; i.e. time to the combined&#xD;
      endpoint, compared to the current strategy/standard care&#xD;
