  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see whether a psychosocial mobile app called&#xD;
      Horizons is effective at improving quality of life, symptom burden, psychological distress,&#xD;
      and coping in patients living with chronic graft-versus host disease (GVHD)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frequently patients living with chronic GVHD experience physical and emotional symptoms&#xD;
      during the course of illness that impacts their quality of life. Patients also often report&#xD;
      difficulty managing many of the tasks they need to do to manage their chronic GVHD. They also&#xD;
      frequently have a lot of questions about chronic GVHD and the expected trajectory of this&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to see whether a psychosocial mobile app called&#xD;
      Horizons is effective at improving quality of life, symptom burden, and psychological&#xD;
      distress in patients with chronic GVHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will randomly assign participants to either receiving Horizons plus usual&#xD;
           care or usual care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrolled participants will be on the research study for up to sixteen weeks and it is&#xD;
           expected that about 120 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society is supporting this research by providing funding.&#xD;
