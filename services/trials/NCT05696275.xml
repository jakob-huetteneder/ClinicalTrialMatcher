  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is expected to propose an industry-university cooperation research case for the&#xD;
      next two years. When cancer patients use ePRO to record subjective fatigue, and smart watches&#xD;
      with 4G communication record objective fatigue, they will be given according to the patient's&#xD;
      current degree of mild, moderate and severe fatigue. Suffer from 'exercise or activity'&#xD;
      advice and lead the implementation of appropriate exercise advice. This study is expected to&#xD;
      design aerobic + anaerobic exercise suitable for mild or moderate patients, and use the&#xD;
      sensor of the smart watch to monitor the effect of exercise and fatigue. To sum up, the&#xD;
      first-year plan is expected to use the established ePRO electronic records, combined with the&#xD;
      LINE communication system, to integrate into a &quot;cancer-related fatigue electronic&#xD;
      registration and care system&quot;; the second-year plan will integrate objective fatigue&#xD;
      classifiers, Establish the exercise care option in the fatigue care system, and use the smart&#xD;
      watch to establish a technology record function of the exercise process to help track the&#xD;
      fatigue level of cancer patients.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline post exercise 5 min</time_frame>
    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the questionnaire consists of seven questions regarding types of physical activity that constitute elements of everyday life. The questions refer to physical activity in the last seven days and concern the time spent sitting and walking as well as the time devoted to vigorous and moderate physical activity. Activities done for at least 10 min at a time are taken into account. This instrument is used to assess physical activity levels-according to the IPAQ scoring protocol, three levels are distinguished, i.e., low, moderate and high.</description>

    <description>HRV is the physiological phenomenon of the variation in the time interval between consecutive heartbeats in milliseconds. A normal, healthy heart does not tick evenly like a metronome, but instead, when looking at the milliseconds between heartbeats, there is constant variation.</description>
