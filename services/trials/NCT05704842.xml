  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assess feasibility of home exercise in reducing fatigue in subjects with breast cancer&#xD;
      receiving curative intent chemotherapy. Subjects are randomized to control (no exercise) or&#xD;
      intervention group (exercise). The PRO-CTCAE tool and FACIT Fatigue Scale are used to collect&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes. Subjects submit data via mobile phone, tablet or computer.&#xD;
      Assessments are weekly during chemotherapy (10-20 wks), at end of chemotherapy and 1, 3 and 6&#xD;
      months after chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to determine the feasibility of a specific home-based exercise&#xD;
      intervention in reducing cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in breast cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
      curative-intent chemotherapy. The outcome will be measured by using the FACIT Fatigue Scale,&#xD;
      administered by using the Carevive PROmptÂ® platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . To examine the feasibility of recruitment and retention of women undergoing treatment&#xD;
           for breast cancer over the duration of the chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the adherence to the exercise regime for those in the intervention group and&#xD;
           compare the retention rates between treatment and control groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compute the means and standard deviations (SD) of the FACIT responses over time in&#xD;
           both groups for use in future power analyses to aid in the design of a futre hypothesis&#xD;
           testing RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To quantify the change over time in PRO-CTCAE derived symptoms and other PROs by&#xD;
           computing means and SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test for group differences in the trajectory of change over time in FACT using a&#xD;
           Mixed Model repeated analysis&#xD;
