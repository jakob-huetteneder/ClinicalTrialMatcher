  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this clinical trial is to test benefits of completing online pain coping&#xD;
      skills training program in women who have been diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer, who&#xD;
      have completed their primary cancer treatment, who are taking an AI medication, and who have&#xD;
      arthralgia. Arthralgia is a type of joint, bone, and muscle pain that is a common side effect&#xD;
      of AI medications. The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether online pain coping skills training reduces the severity of pain and the&#xD;
           interference it causes in women's daily lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether online pain coping skills training improves emotional distress, quality of life,&#xD;
           and adherence to AI medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Whether benefits of online pain coping skills training are at least partially caused by&#xD;
           women's increased confidence that they can manage their pain and a reduction in&#xD;
           unhelpful thinking patterns about pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Whether online pain coping skills training improves effects of AI medications on sleep&#xD;
           problems and symptoms of menopause like hot flashes and night sweats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can complete all parts of the study at home. They will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete four sets of questionnaires throughout the study, which will take about 9 to 10&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Attend 3 meetings in the first month of the study, all of which can be held via a video&#xD;
           conference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use an electronic pill bottle to track their use of their AI medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Be randomized (like flipping a coin) to one of two study arms: They will either receive&#xD;
           education about AIs and arthralgia or they will receive this education along with access&#xD;
           to an online pain coping skills training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research will compare the education group to the education plus online pain coping skills&#xD;
      training group to see if online pain coping skills training has the benefits mentioned above.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive their usual medical care and an educational booklet with information about Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs), side effects they cause including painful arthralgia, methods for managing arthralgia, and tips for talking with doctors about arthralgia and other AI side effects. They will also be given access to an online pain coping skills training program and asked to complete it at home over 8 to 10 weeks. This interactive, web-based program teaches cognitive and behavioral skills that research has shown can reduce pain and pain-related interference with daily activities. The program includes eight sessions that participants will complete at a rate of about 1 per week. Each session takes 35-45 minutes. Participants will be shown how to use the program and can contact the study team if they have any problems with it. Participants who do not have a device capable of accessing the program will be loaned a tablet computer for the study.</description>

&#xD;
               -  Completed chemotherapy or radiation therapy less than four weeks prior to&#xD;

               -  Completed surgery less than 8 weeks prior to enrollment (because surgery can&#xD;
                  cause temporary post-surgical pain that typically resolves in this period of&#xD;
                  time); minor surgeries may be allowed more recently than 8 weeks at the&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Data will be shared according to the most recent NIH guidelines for sharing research data (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/). Findings will be disseminated through presentations at national scientific meetings and peer-reviewed manuscripts. We will make our data available for review and/or research to qualified individuals after the main findings from the final dataset are accepted for publication. Individuals requesting data will be asked to describe their goals, data needs and planned analyses including statistical power. Requests will be reviewed by a Data Access Committee made up of the project's key personnel. This committee will evaluate scientific validity, statistical power, overlap with other analyses/publications, and ethical aspects of the proposed use of the data. We will protect the rights and privacy of our study participants by de-identifying the data and taking any other steps necessary to eliminate potential deductive disclosure.</ipd_description>
