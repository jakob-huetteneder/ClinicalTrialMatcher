      A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Teclistamab in Combination with&#xD;
      Daratumumab, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone with or without Bortezomib as Induction Therapy&#xD;
      and Teclistamab in Combination with Daratumumab and Lenalidomide as Maintenance Therapy in&#xD;
      Participants with Newly Diagnosed Transplant Eligible Multiple Myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Tec-DRd and Tec-DVRd as&#xD;
      induction therapy and Tec-DR as post-transplant maintenance therapy in participants with&#xD;
      ND-TEMM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Tec-DRd and Tec-DVRd as induction&#xD;
      therapy and Tec-DR as post-transplant maintenance therapy.&#xD;

      OVERALL DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 participants will be enrolled with approximately 30 participants in Arm A and Arm B&#xD;
      combined and 20 participants in Arm C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arms A and B will receive Induction Therapy of 6 cycles (28-days each):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Tec-DRd (Arm A) or Tec-DVRd (Arm B) followed by HDT and a single ASCT according to&#xD;
      local SoC treatment. Thereafter a Maintenance Therapy of 18 cycles with Tec-DR is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Arm C participants will enter the study for maintenance treatment of 18 cycles with&#xD;
      Tec-DR, after induction, HDT and ASCT according to local SoC (outside of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive maintenance treatment with Tec-DR for a maximum of 18 cycles or&#xD;
      until confirmed progressive disease, death, intolerable toxicity, loss to follow-up, or&#xD;
      consent withdrawal, whichever comes first. Periodic safety evaluations will be conducted to&#xD;
      ensure that treatment is safe and tolerable. Upon treatment discontinuation, an EOT Visit&#xD;
      will be conducted. Thereafter, the participant will continue in the Follow-up Phase until&#xD;
      death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or end of the study, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

Induction therapy is followed by HDT and a single ASCT according to local SoC. After ASCT, participants will receive maintenance treatment with Tec-DR.&#xD;
Arm C participants will enter the study at Maintenance Treatment with Tec-DR after induction, HDT, and ASCT according to local SoC (outside of the study).&#xD;
Arm A, B and C will receive maintenance treatment for a maximum of 18 cycles or until confirmed progressive disease, death, intolerable toxicity, loss to follow-up, or consent withdrawal, whichever comes first.&#xD;
Periodic safety evaluations will be conducted to ensure that treatment is safe and tolerable.</intervention_model_description>
