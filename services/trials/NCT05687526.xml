      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple doses of&#xD;
      Telitacicept in subjects with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) on a&#xD;
      background of standard of care therapy and explore the safety and efficacy of Telitacicept in&#xD;
