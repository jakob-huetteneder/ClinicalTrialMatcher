  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective interventional study is to compare the bioavailability of the&#xD;
      6S-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) glucosamine salt versus two other forms of 5- MTHF&#xD;
      calcium salts by measuring serum 5-MTHF responses after a single ingestion of equivalent&#xD;
      doses of the three folate forms in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that the test products 5-MTHF glucosamine and calcium salts&#xD;
      have equivalent bioavailabilities in serum 5-MTHF as measured by the area under the curve&#xD;
      over a period of 24 hours (AUC0-24h) after consumption of a single dose of 5-MTHF (400μg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a single dose of each of the following products separated by a&#xD;
      7-day wash-out period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5-MTHF glucosamine salt&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5-MTHF calcium salt 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5-MTHF calcium salt 2&#xD;

    <masking_description>The randomization list will be drawn up before the beginning of the study by a person not related to the study and stored confidentially. Every effort will be made to maintain the blind during the study.&#xD;
The labelling will not show any difference (including batch number and use-by date) between the test and the comparative products.&#xD;
During the whole study and in the absence of unblinding, neither the investigators, service providers, nor the participant will be aware of the product they test or can deduce the group they belong to.&#xD;
The unblinding will occur after the database locking, at the end of the study. The unblinding will be in charge of the person responsible for the randomization list.&#xD;
Whether an emergency unblinding procedure may occur (i.e., SAE), the date and the reason for the unblinding will be indicated in the electronic Case Report Form (e-CRF) and the source document of the study.</masking_description>
