  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of intravenous and intraosseous antibiotic&#xD;
      administration techniques during tourniquetless total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: Comparable levels of vancomycin will be found in distal femur, proximal&#xD;
      tibia, and periarticular soft tissues, as well as in systemic levels, between the intravenous&#xD;
      and intraosseous administration groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: Compare 30- and 90-day post-operative complication rates (infection)&#xD;
      between the control (standard IV administration of vancomycin) versus the interventional&#xD;
      group (intraosseous administration of vancomycin). The research team hypothesizes that there&#xD;
      will be no difference in complication (infection) rates between groups&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial. The anticipated total number of participants in this study is 20 patients in each treatment arm: 20 patients will be given IV Vancomycin, 20 patients will be given IO vancomycin. This sample size is based on previous studies examining vancomycin concentration in primary TKA between IO vs IV</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Patients will receive the Houston Methodist Hospital orthopedic surgery standard of care pre-operative antibiotic regimen for primary total knee arthroplasty patients. This includes IV antibiotics (typically ancef or cefepime and vancomycin) will be started in the pre-operative period approximately 1 hour prior to incision (vancomycin dose weight-based at approximately 15mg/kg [12,13] generally 1000-1750mg in 500mL NS).</description>

    <description>IV antibiotics (per physician's standard of care): Typically ancef or cefepime is started in pre-op within 1 hour of incision. IV Vancomycin will not be administered preoperatively in this group.&#xD;
IO vancomycin is administered via an intraosseous cannulation device (Arrow EZ-IO; Teleflex, Morrisville, NC) in the OR after sterile prep and draping has occurred prior to skin incision (500mg in 150mL NS).&#xD;
Injection will take place into the tibial tubercle (within a pre-specified region) immediately prior to incision.</description>
