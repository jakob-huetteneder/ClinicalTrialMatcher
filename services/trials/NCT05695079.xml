  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the increasing regularity and intensity of hot weather and heat waves, there is an&#xD;
      urgent need to develop heat-alleviation strategies able to provide targeted protection for&#xD;
      heat-vulnerable older adults. While air-conditioning provides the most effective protection&#xD;
      from extreme heat, it is inaccessible for many individuals. Air-conditioning is also energy&#xD;
      intensive, which can strain the electrical grid and, depending on the source of electricity&#xD;
      generation, contribute to increasing green house gas emissions. For these reasons, recent&#xD;
      guidance has advocated the use of electric fans as a simple and sustainable alternative to&#xD;
      air-conditioning. To date, however, only one study has assessed the efficacy of fan use in&#xD;
      older adults and demonstrated that fans accelerate increases in body temperature and heart&#xD;
      rate in a short-duration (~2 hours) resting exposure to 42°C with increasing ambient humidity&#xD;
      from 30-70%. While subsequent modelling has suggested that fans can improve heat loss via&#xD;
      sweat evaporation in healthy older adults at air temperatures up to 38°C, there is currently&#xD;
      no empirical data to support these claims. Further, that work assumed older adults were&#xD;
      seated in front of a pedestal fan generating an airflow of 3·5-4·5 m/s at the front of the&#xD;
      body. This airflow cannot be attained by most marketed pedestal fans. Studies are therefore&#xD;
      needed to evaluate the efficacy of fans for preventing hyperthermia and the associated&#xD;
      physiological burden in older adults in air temperatures below 38°C and determine whether the&#xD;
      cooling effect of fans, if any, is evident at lower rates of airflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these knowledge gaps, this randomized crossover trial will evaluate body core&#xD;
      temperature, cardiovascular strain, dehydration, and thermal comfort in adults aged 65-85&#xD;
      years exposed for 8 hours to conditions experienced during hot weather and heat waves in&#xD;
      North America simulated using a climate chamber (36°C, 45% relative humidity). Each&#xD;
      participant will complete three randomized exposures that will differ only in the airflow&#xD;
      generated at the front of the body via an electric pedestal fan: no airflow (control), low&#xD;
      airflow (~2 m/s), and high airflow (~4 m/s). While participants will spend most of the 8-hour&#xD;
      exposure seated in front of the fan, they will also complete 4 x 10 min periods of&#xD;
      'activities of daily living' (~2-2.5 METS, light stepping) at ~2 hour intervals to more&#xD;
      accurately reflect activity patterns in the home.&#xD;
