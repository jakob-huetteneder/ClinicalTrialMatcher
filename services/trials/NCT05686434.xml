  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open, single-center, single-arm phase II clinical study with common&#xD;
      EGFR-sensitive mutations (Ex19del and L858R) identified in the central laboratory.To evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of adjuvant Osimertinib therapy in completely resected stage I&#xD;
      non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with high-risk factors (solid and/or&#xD;
      micropapillary component ≥10%, and/or airway spread).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be tested for the status of EGFR-sensitive mutations prior to enrollment and&#xD;
      confirmed positive by central laboratory testing.The surgically removed tumor foci will be&#xD;
      confirmed by central laboratory pathologic examination for their pathological subtypes, solid&#xD;
      and/or micropapillary components ≥10%, and/or STAS positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients had undergone complete resection of the tumor, and 65 patients who met the&#xD;
      criteria for inclusion were enrolled to receive Osimertinib. Patients had to be enrolled and&#xD;
      given Osimertinib within 10 weeks of complete resection.The dose of Osimertinib in this study&#xD;
      was 80 mg once a day and the planned duration of treatment was 3 years (156 weeks). Patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated for safety and efficacy at baseline, at week 12, and every 12 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter until completion or termination of treatment. Patients were followed up every 24&#xD;
      weeks to 5 years (264 weeks) and annually thereafter for disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival (OS) was observed every 24 weeks for 5 years (264 weeks) after disease&#xD;
      recurrence and annually thereafter.The primary endpoint of the study was 3-year DFS rate.&#xD;
      Disease-free survival (DFS) should be calculated from the date of entry on Osimertinib to the&#xD;
      date of disease recurrence or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the primary analysis (3-year DFS rate), patients' survival status will be followed up&#xD;
      according to the simplified study plan (OS analysis period) until the final OS analysis data&#xD;
      is available. In the event of disease recurrence, patients will be re-staged and all sites of&#xD;
      recurrence of NSCLC will be recorded. It will be up to the doctor to decide what treatment&#xD;
      the patient will receive after a relapse;and cancer treatment after recurrence will be&#xD;
      documented.Taken together, all primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints in this study&#xD;
      strongly describe the overall benefit of adjuvant Osimertinib in a population of patients&#xD;
      with high-risk EGFRm+ stage I NSCLC who have been surgically completely resected.&#xD;
