  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visually impaired seniors are susceptible to having lower Quality of Life (QOL)1-4. The&#xD;
      current situation-specific stressors including the fear of contracting COVID-19, prolonged&#xD;
      periods of self-isolation, reduced mobility, greater dependence on caregivers or family&#xD;
      members, reduced or no social interactions, inability to visit clinics for non-emergency&#xD;
      treatments and surgeries, and financial uncertainty may further deteriorate the QOL of&#xD;
      seniors with eye diseases. In this study, patients with moderate glaucoma aged 65 and above&#xD;
      will be randomized to Art of Meditation (AOM) plus Treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone to&#xD;
      assess the changes in Health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Patients in the AOM group will&#xD;
      be taught a meditation technique by trained instructors while the patients in the TAU group&#xD;
      continue to receive standard of care. It is hypothesized that it's feasible to assess the&#xD;
      effects of AOM in a sample of glaucoma patients during COVID-19 pandemic, and that glaucoma&#xD;
      patients will experience enhanced QOL, reduced depression and anxiety, and improved sleep&#xD;
      quality by participating in the AOM intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Art of Meditation (AOM) is a type of meditation that helps quiet the mind and induces physiological and mental relaxation whilst the eyes are shut. It utilizes a specific sound value (mantra) to draw attention inward and permit the mind to experience a restful but alert state of consciousness. Participants will receive three weekly online instructions (90 minutes each) by trained instructors in addition to standard care.</description>

    <description>The usual standard of care for patients with glaucoma includes starting them on first line of drugs. Participants will be initiated and maintained on appropriate dosages of such medications as part of standard of care. The usual standard of care also includes an ophthalmic examination measuring best-corrected Snellen VA and pinhole acuities and a follow-up visit once a year.</description>
