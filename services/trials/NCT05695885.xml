    <textblock>
      This study will inform understanding of how to support emerging adults with autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder (ASD). The investigators will use a theoretically informed and research-based&#xD;
      transition support program developed for people with ASD and test how effective it is when&#xD;
      delivered by community agencies. Results will provide information on the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      program as well as on mechanisms of change and contextual factors that promote or impede&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research is to improve adult outcomes for people with autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorder (ASD). Autistic adolescents and young adults tend to have worse outcomes&#xD;
      with respect to employment, education, and quality of life, than neurotypical peers. These&#xD;
      outcomes include under-enrollment into college, unemployment, and limited functional&#xD;
      independence. Research-informed transition planning that addresses core impairments in skills&#xD;
      related to adult autonomy, including self-knowledge, self-determination, and self-regulation,&#xD;
      may improve outcomes for this growing population. In prior research, investigators developed&#xD;
      a stakeholder involved transition program (STEPS) and found it to be feasible, acceptable,&#xD;
      and efficacious. Data from a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) focusing on feasibility&#xD;
      indicated that it was acceptable to participants and suggested STEPS was effective in&#xD;
      improving readiness for transition to adulthood. The team will now test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      STEPS, and engagement of target mechanisms, in partnership with four community agencies. This&#xD;
      study is designed as a Hybrid Type 1, which focuses primarily on intervention effectiveness&#xD;
      with a secondary focus on factors related to implementation. Immediate (post-treatment) and&#xD;
      longer-term (six month follow-up) clinical outcomes of adult functional outcomes and&#xD;
      vocational engagement will be assessed. The degree to which STEPS leads to change in the&#xD;
      theoretical mediating mechanisms (i.e., adult autonomy skills) will be examined, as well as a&#xD;
      formal test of mediation (i.e., the degree to which change in adult autonomy skills leads to&#xD;
      change in adult functional outcomes). Providers will provide qualitative information on&#xD;
      implementation such as thoughts on STEPS' cultural sensitivity, and quantitative data on the&#xD;
      appropriateness, feasibility, and acceptability of STEPS. Providers' sustained use of STEPS&#xD;
      with clients in the six months after study enrollment has ended will also be tracked. This&#xD;
      research will produce findings that have the potential to shift clinical practice related to&#xD;
      transition to adulthood for people with ASD. In light of the fact that approximately 70,000&#xD;
      people with ASD age into adulthood every year and the economic burden associated with ASD,&#xD;
      the potential public health impact of this research is considerable.&#xD;

    <description>This caregiver and self-report questionnaire has a range of possible scores from 30 to 120, with higher scores indicating greater readiness.assigned condition. Scores are categorical in nature: 0 = no evidence of progression toward goals, 1 = some evidence, 2 = strong evidence of progression toward goals.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>This is a questionnaire completed by caregiver and participant. Higher scores indicate greater autonomy, independence, and satisfaction. On the self-report measure scores range as follows for Frequency: social engagement (0-56), outside meaningful activities (0-32), self-care (0-88), independence (0-56), and romance (0-16) and level of support ranges are: social engagement (0-68), outside meaningful activities (0-32), self-care (0-76), independence (0-48), finances (0-12), and satisfaction (0-132). On caregiver-report, frequency subscales range as follows: degree of social contact (0-28), social initiation (0-60), work/finances (0-64), autonomy (0-56), care of self and home (0-72), and support subscales range as follows: social engagement (0-68), self-care (0-144), work activity (0-28), independence (0-16), and finances (0-24).</description>

    <description>This brief interview on progress made toward educational or employment goals is completed with participant and caregiver, conducted by an examiner unaware of assigned condition. Scores are categorical in nature: 0 = no evidence of progress toward goals, 1 = some evidence of progress toward goals, 2 = moderate evidence of progress toward goals, and 3 = clear strong evidence of progress toward goals. Higher scores indicate greater goal attainment.</description>
