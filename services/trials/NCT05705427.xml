  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of a prophylaxis-for-all&#xD;
      approach to prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in&#xD;
      the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). HBV-infected pregnant women will be randomized to&#xD;
      either receive tenofovir or placebo beginning at 28-32 weeks' gestation and continuing&#xD;
      through 4 weeks' postpartum. Women will be followed every 4-6 weeks throughout the prenatal&#xD;
      and postpartum period to evaluate for side effects related to the medication. Infants will&#xD;
      receive a birth-dose of HBV vaccine, ideally within 24 hours. Participants will be followed&#xD;
      longitudinally through 6 months' postpartum.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall study design is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among two&#xD;
      groups of mother-infant dyads: women who receive TDF vs placebo in late pregnancy and the&#xD;
      postpartum period (beginning at 28-32 weeks' gestation and continuing through 4 weeks'&#xD;
      postpartum). While official World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations are to continue&#xD;
      TDF at least through delivery, a range from delivery through 12 weeks' postpartum is&#xD;
      possible; the investigators will continue therapy through 4 weeks' postpartum in this study.&#xD;
      This feasibility trial will evaluate the acceptability, safety and preliminary effectiveness&#xD;
      of a TDF-for-all approach to prevent MTCT of HBV in low-resource settings. HBsAg-positive&#xD;
      pregnant women will be enrolled at 28-32 weeks' gestation, and will present for regular&#xD;
      medication checks, with a study closeout visit at 24 weeks' postpartum. Study activities at&#xD;
      monthly medication checks will include medication refills, assessment of adherence (via pill&#xD;
      counts and verbal surveys), and evaluation for side effects. All infants will receive a&#xD;
      birth-dose of HBV vaccine within 24 hours of life. MTCT of HBV will be defined as the&#xD;
      proportion of infants with positive HBsAg testing at 6 months. This pilot study will provide&#xD;
      preliminary data for sample size calculations, including safety and effectiveness data, to&#xD;
      prepare for larger RCTs to determine the effectiveness of a tenofovir-for-all approach, as&#xD;
      well as the added benefit of tenofovir over birth-dose vaccination.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Pregnant women will be randomized at the time of enrollment (at 28-32 weeks' gestation) in a 1:1 ratio to receive tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) vs placebo, with an expected 140 women in the TDF arm and 140 in the placebo arm. A permuted block randomization technique will be employed to ensure equal distribution between the two arms at the two maternity centers. A biostatistician from the University of North Carolina (UNC) will design the randomization scheme, which will utilize the randomization-and-concealment feature within the REDCap database; the biostatistician will not be directly involved in study enrollment activities. REDCap personnel at UNC will ensure proper design and use of the randomization-and-concealment feature, and study personnel will receive training on the randomization process prior to study roll-out.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The trial will be double-blinded, with study staff and participants blinded to allocation to the TDF vs placebo arm. Blinding to medication type will be achieved via use of over-encapsulation of TDF and placebo pills. Laboratory technicians who perform point-of-care hepatitis B core related antigen testing, HBV viral load testing and hepatitis B e antigen testing will be blinded to study arm.</masking_description>
