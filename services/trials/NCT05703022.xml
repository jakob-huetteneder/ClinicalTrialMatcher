      A prospective, interventional, single-group, single centre study to evaluate the feasibility&#xD;
      of early aerobic exercise training in patients following heart valve surgery for infective&#xD;
      endocarditis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infective endocarditis (IE)is uncommon, but people with some heart conditions have a greater&#xD;
      risk of developing it. Well designed studies have shown that the majority of the IE&#xD;
      population have low physical function and many are inactive. This is negative for their&#xD;
      health and well-being. High-intensity aerobic interval training has shown to be beneficial in&#xD;
      patients with other cardiovascular disorders. Presumably, patients with IE also benefit from&#xD;
      such treatment, but the optimal training mode,intensity, frequency and duration to improve&#xD;
      aerobic capacity are not clear. This study will explore how aerobic interval training&#xD;
      supported by smartwatch may contribute to the physical activity after infective endocarditis&#xD;
      . Throughout the project, investigators will explore opportunities and barriers for&#xD;
      supervised individualised exercise training for IE patients that has been treated with heart&#xD;
      valve surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to explore how early aerobic interval training can be safely&#xD;
      performed and accepted in patients with infective endocarditis after heart valve surgery. The&#xD;
      two main research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How is aerobic interval training experienced by patients with IE after heart-valve&#xD;
           surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can aerobic interval training with smartwatch support be accepted and safely performed&#xD;
           by patients who have undergone endocarditis and left-sided heart-valve surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a single centre feasibility study, at the University Hospital of North Norway in&#xD;
      Tromsø .The study duration from the first assessment of the first patient to the last&#xD;
      assesment of the last patient: 24 months. The in-hospital training intervention for each&#xD;
      patient will start between 7 and 21 days after the heart valve surgery and continue in&#xD;
      university or local hospital for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit between 10 and 20 participants from the University Hospital of&#xD;
      North Norway.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will start between 7 and 21 days after heart valve surgery. While hospitalized the participants will perform supervised aerobic interval training comprised 4x4 minute, 3 times per week. Intensity will start at 60% of maximum heart rate in the first week, around 13-14 in Borg RPE-Scale. The workload will be gradually increased as the participant tolerance improves, but not above 85% of maximum heart rate or 16-17 in Borg RPE Scale.</description>
