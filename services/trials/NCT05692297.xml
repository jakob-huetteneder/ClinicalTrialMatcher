      Objective: To verify the efficacy and safety of denosumab in the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      CKD-MBD in CKD patients with high risk of fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A cohort of CKD patients with high risk of fracture was established and followed up&#xD;
      for long periods (≥24 months). Patients with CKD3b-5D stage and fracture risk assessment tool&#xD;
      (FRAX) scores at high risk or very high risk of fracture were enrolled. A multicenter,&#xD;
      prospective, open-label, randomised controlled, interventional study was conducted. The&#xD;
      patients were divided into two groups. The patients in the denosumab group received&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection of denosumab 60mg once every 6 months, and the patients in the&#xD;
      non-denosumab group received conventional treatment. Bone metabolic markers (serum calcium,&#xD;
      phosphorus, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, tartrate-resistant acid&#xD;
      phosphatase 5b, osteocalcin, total N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen, etc.), bone&#xD;
      mineral density (dual-energy X-ray, quantitative CT), and vascular calcification score were&#xD;
      regularly monitored. All adverse events (all-cause death, cardiovascular death, cardiac&#xD;
      events, fracture, hospitalization, emergency department visits, etc.) were recorded during&#xD;
      the follow-up period. Bone mineral density and clinical parameters were compared between the&#xD;
      two groups.&#xD;

    <description>Fifty-one patients were randomly assigned to the denosumab group, which received subcutaneous injection of denosumab 60mg once every 6 months. Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, iPTH, tPINP, 25(OH)VitD, DXA and qCT were measured before medication. Serum calcium, phosphorus and iPTH were examined at day 1, 7 and 14, alkaline phosphatase, tPINP and 25(OH)VitD at day 7 and 14, and electrocardiogram at day 1 and 7 after treatment. Intravenous calcium supplementation was required if muscle spasms and QT prolongation occurred. Six months after medication, subcutaneous injections of denosumab 60mg were repeated. The protocol was repeated every 6 months, totally 24 months. Bone mineral density, clinical parameters and adverse events were evaluated at 24 months.</description>

    <description>The other 51 patients did not use denosumab and used other medications, such as diphosphonates, active vitamin D and/or active vitamin D analogue, calcimimetics, calcitonin, estrogen receptor agonists, etc. At the same time, calcium and vitamin D were supplemented. The baseline serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, iPTH, tPINP, 25(OH)VitD, DXA, and qCT were measured. The above parameters were rechecked every 6 months, and the medications was recorded, totally 24 months.</description>
