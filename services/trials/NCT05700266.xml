  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the clinical trial is to test the effect of oral rivaroxaban plus aspirin&#xD;
      in patients with recent stroke/ transient ischemic attack (TIA) caused by intracranial artery&#xD;
      stenosis. Participants will be divided into 2 groups to receive either oral rivaroxaban plus&#xD;
      aspirin or oral clopidogrel plus aspirin. The main question it aims to answer is whether the&#xD;
      experimental group (oral rivaroxaban plus aspirin) is superior to the control group ( oral&#xD;
      clopidogrel plus aspirin) to lower recurrent stroke/TIA or death in these patients during 1&#xD;
      year of follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial atherosclerosis stenosis (ICAS) accounts for up to 30-50% of strokes amongst&#xD;
      Asian patient cohorts, in contrast to 5-10% of strokes amongst western patient cohorts. The&#xD;
      SAMMPRIS established aggressive medical management (dual antiplatelet therapy using asprin&#xD;
      and clopidogrel, intensive management of vascular risk factors, and lifestyle modification)&#xD;
      as a superior choice for symptomatic ICAS compared to the percutaneous transluminal&#xD;
      angioplasty and stenting. However, around 15% still had recurrent stroke or death during a&#xD;
      median follow-up of 32.4 months in SAMMPRIS study in the aggressive medical management group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rivaroxaban is a Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) that Directly and&#xD;
      selectively inhibits factor Xa. 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommended that&#xD;
      adding rivaroxaban (2.5mg twice a day) to aspirin for long-term secondary prevention in&#xD;
      patients with chronic coronary syndromes (post-myocardial infarction &gt;1 year) may be&#xD;
      considered (IIB). 2020 ESC also recommended the adding of rivaroxaban (2.5mg twice a day for&#xD;
      1 year) to aspirin plus clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome (IIB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will directly compare rivaroxaban on top of aspirin with clopidogrel on&#xD;
      top of asprin for preventing recurrent stroke/TIA and death in recent stroke/TIA patients&#xD;
      with ICAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators calculated that a sample of 1180 patients (590 in each arm) would provide&#xD;
      80% power to detect a relative risk reduction of 35% in the ravaxaban-aspirin group, with a&#xD;
      two-sided type I error of 0.05, assuming an event rate of 15% in the clopidogrel-aspirin&#xD;
      group and a 5% overall rate of withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline features of the two groups were compared with the use of an independent group t-test&#xD;
      (for means) or chi-square test (for percentages). Analysis of primary and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      was based on Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative incidence. All analyses were performed on&#xD;
      an intention-to-treat basis, unless specified otherwise. All tests were two-sided, and a P&#xD;
      value of 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses&#xD;
      were performed with the use of SPSS software.&#xD;
