  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the effects of different cleaning regimes i.e. chemical and&#xD;
      mechanical on biofilm formation of an acrylic based removable orthodontic appliance and to&#xD;
      find out if surface modification i.e. polished acrylic fitting surface, have an impact on&#xD;
      cleaning the biofilm formation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is double-blind, parallel, randomized clinical trial conducted in the orthodontic clinic&#xD;
      after obtaining the ethical approval from the ethics committee of the department. Thirty nine&#xD;
      orthodontic patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be included in the study and will&#xD;
      be provided by the patient information sheet and consent form that will explain the nature of&#xD;
      the study. After initial approval from the patient an alginate impression of the maxillary&#xD;
      arch will be taken and a negative replica will be made by type IV stone. The wire framework&#xD;
      of the removable appliance will be fabricated according to the design for the case. After&#xD;
      applying a separating medium, an acrylic base will be fabricated using the orthodontic&#xD;
      acrylic powder and liquid (Orthocryle, Dentaurum, Ispringen, German) with a ratio of (2.5&#xD;
      parts powder to 1 part liquid) according to the manufacturer's instruction with four wells on&#xD;
      each side of the fitting surface of the appliance. Acrylic samples i.e. tiles of different&#xD;
      surface texture will be made. An acrylic sheet of 1 mm thickness will be made using a mold&#xD;
      material. One sheet will be polished using a conventional polishing technique until a glossy&#xD;
      surface appears, whereas, the other sheet will be kept without modification. Tiles of 5mm in&#xD;
      diameter will be bored using a trephine bur on both sides of the acrylic sheets and each set&#xD;
      of tiles i.e. the polished and unpolished samples will be color coated from its seated&#xD;
      surface. The acrylic tiles (5mm in diameter and 1mm thickness) will be placed and fixed into&#xD;
      the holes created using sticky wax. The acrylic samples will be randomly seated, The&#xD;
      appliance will be sterilized using proper sterilization protocol. The removable appliance&#xD;
      will be assigned randomly and blindly and fitted into the oral cavity of the patient for one&#xD;
      week. Each individual will be given by an independent person a pack containing the cleansing&#xD;
      pack and an instruction sheet describing the cleaning regimen for his/ her appliance. The&#xD;
      packs are similar in shape and color and will be prepared by a third person who does not know&#xD;
      the purpose of the study. The participant will be grouped into three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Brushing with denture brush and chlorhexidine (CHX) toothpaste (lacalut Active, Germany)&#xD;
           for one minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Chemical cleaning i.e. Lacalut cleaning tablet (lacalut DENT cleaning tab, Germany),&#xD;
           fill the cup to the marked line (150 mL) with tap water, dissolve one cleansing tablet&#xD;
           and wait for 20 minutes then wash it with tap water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Combination of brushing with CHX toothpaste and cleaning tablet. At the end of the study&#xD;
           period, the acrylic samples will be removed carefully and applied into a petri dish&#xD;
           containing PBS via a sterile tweezer. The samples will be then immersed twice in a 25ml&#xD;
           sterile tubes containing PBS to remove the planktonic bacteria and inserted into 5ml&#xD;
           bijou tube containing 1mm PBS. The sample will be vortex mixed for 1 minute to&#xD;
           disseminate the biofilm and create a homogenous solution. Ten-fold serial dilutions will&#xD;
           be carried out in PBS before the samples are plated onto blood agar (BA), to give the&#xD;
           total anaerobic count, mitis salivarius agar (MS), a selective agar for streptococci&#xD;
           spp. and Mannitol salt agar (MA) for Staphylococci spp. BA and MS plates will be&#xD;
           incubated anaerobically for 2-4 days at 37ÂºC using anaerobic cabinet whereas the MA will&#xD;
           be incubated for 2 days in aerobic condition. All organisms from both selective and&#xD;
           nonselective agars will be distinguished by colony morphology and will be characterized&#xD;
           by Gram reaction and other confirmatory tests: 1. Catalase testing 2. Coagulase testing&#xD;

The packs are similar in shape and color and will be prepared by a third person who does not know the purpose of the study. The volunteer will be grouped into three groups:&#xD;
Group 1: patients will be instructed to brush both sides of the removable appliance once a day for 1 minute before bedtime using the denture brush and the CHX toothpaste (lacalut active, Germany) provided and water. Group 2: patients will be instructed to immerse the appliance in 150 ml cup with tap water and dissolve one cleansing (lacalut DENT cleaning tablet, Germany) tablet for 20 minutes according to the manufacture instructions.

Each envelope includes the treatment allocation card (group 1, 2 or 3) and the related cleaning method with instruction card.&#xD;
Blinding: An independent person will be responsible for giving the patient the envelope, all data collection and counting will be completed by a microbiologist who would not know about the study.</masking_description>
