    <description>The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS DRSS) was developed to categorize the severity of diabetic retinopathy based on several fundus photographic characteristics. There are 13 levels in the original ETDRS scale, and a severity step or level increase is associated with an increased risk of retinopathy progression. The scale goes from 10 to 85, with higher scores being worse.</description>
