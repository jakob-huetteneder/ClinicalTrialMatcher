    <textblock>
      This project will investigate the efficacy of a cognitive remediation programme in patients&#xD;
      treated for breast cancer. patients will be randomized between &quot;no intervention&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;intervention programme&quot;. Efficay will be assessed in term of improved quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical progress in the treatment of cancer has prolonged patients' life expectancy. This&#xD;
      improvement has led researchers to become concerned about the long-term negative effects of&#xD;
      cancer treatments on quality-of-life. In particular, previous studies have identified&#xD;
      complaints that have been submitted concerning the cognitive status of patients treated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy (Berglund et coll., 1991). All of these cognitive changes are collectively&#xD;
      grouped under the term chemobrain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consequences of treatments remain however underestimated, as the priority when diagnosing&#xD;
      cancer remains the patient's short- to medium-term survival; yet, quality-of-life contributes&#xD;
      to the long-term survival of patients (Kramer, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to medical treatments, psychosocial care adapted to the specific needs of&#xD;
      subjects is thus important for improving their quality-of-life and helping them return to&#xD;
      work. Even if initiatives have multiplied over the past few decades in the psychosocial&#xD;
      management of these subjects (e.g., supportive care), that related to cognitive disorders in&#xD;
      subjects having survived cancer remains a little documented field. Cognitive deficiency in&#xD;
      cancer survivors is said to be moderate (Razaq et coll., 2017), which makes survivors ideal&#xD;
      candidates for cognitive rehabilitation.&#xD;

    <description>The cognitive remediation programme shall be run either in video workshops or face to face workshops and in home sessions via a web app. The programme will run for 4 months during which there will be 3 different evaluations. A first evaluation after randomisation, a second evaluation 4 months after inclusion (corresponding to the end of the programme), and a third evaluation 8 months after inclusion for the experimental group (4 months after the end of the programme). The face to face workshops will take 8 to 10 participants and will be led by a neuropsychologist.</description>
