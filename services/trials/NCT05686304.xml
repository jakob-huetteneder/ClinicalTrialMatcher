  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This experimental study aims to develop an internet-based self-help money management program&#xD;
      that improve financial self-efficacy and its associated adverse outcomes among adult&#xD;
      population with severe mental illness. In particular, this study compares the efficacy of the&#xD;
      internet-delivered self-help money management program with the wait-list control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online money management program course will consist of 4 weekly modules, incorporating&#xD;
      the key components of money management and the Model of Human Occupation (MOHO). The program&#xD;
      include the concept of money management, money management skill, and risk of financial&#xD;
      exploitation. The main component of each module will be presented in video format, quiz, and&#xD;
      homework. Materials will be presented interactively to facilitate engagement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Money management is necessary for people with severe mental illness (SMI) to live safely in&#xD;
      the community. Collective evidence has suggested that mental disorder leads to drift into&#xD;
      poverty, is strong. Most of them struggle to meet basic needs with their existing income.&#xD;
      Financial instability has been consistently linked to an increased risk of relapse. This&#xD;
      experimental study aims to develop an internet-based self-help money management program that&#xD;
      improve financial self-efficacy and its associated adverse outcomes among adult population&#xD;
      with severe mental illness. Its efficacy will be compared with the wait-list control group.&#xD;
      We hypothesized that (1) participants who received a money management program will improve&#xD;
      financial self-efficacy after the intervention as compared with the wait-list controls; (2)&#xD;
      participants from the money management program will have better financial well-being after&#xD;
      the intervention as compared with the wait-list controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
