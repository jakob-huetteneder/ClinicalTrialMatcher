  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to perform a landmark study to answer whether a combined CVD&#xD;
      screening and treatment strategy is beneficial for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM)&#xD;
      without known cardiovascular disease (CVD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to answer the following main research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do screening detected high-risk patients benefit of intensified medical treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is it safe to de-intensify medical treatment among patients with a screening detected low&#xD;
      risk of CVD?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does a CVD screening and treatment program improve patient reported health status?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular risk remains high in patients with T2DM but unevenly distributed. Our current&#xD;
      risk stratification strategies are far from optimal leading to both under- and over-treatment&#xD;
      of patients. In recent years, noninvasive imaging of subclinical coronary artery disease by&#xD;
      cardiac CT has improved considerably. This allows for easily accessible evaluations of&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerosis burden and composition - exceptionally strong imaging biomarkers of&#xD;
      future cardiovascular disease. An increasing amount of data suggests that cardiac CT may&#xD;
      permit better risk stratification in patients with T2DM. At the same time, the pharmaceutical&#xD;
      treatment of T2DM has changed with several new and expensive drug classes, each individually&#xD;
      documented to reduce the risk for new or recurrent cardiovascular events. Thus, these new&#xD;
      drugs may improve outcome in high-risk patients, whereas they may be wasteful and only lead&#xD;
      to side effects in low-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Inten-CT study, the investigators combine these two pivotal developments. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to improve risk stratification of patients with T2DM by use of cardiac&#xD;
      CT and, based on this knowledge, the investigators wish to investigate if upgraded medical&#xD;
      treatment in the high-risk population is beneficial and if de-intensified treatment in the&#xD;
      low-risk population is safe. As a secondary aim, the investigators wish to investigate if&#xD;
      such a strategy improves patient reported health status. These aims are in agreement with one&#xD;
      of the important health indicators from The Danish College of General Practitioners: &quot;We find&#xD;
      and treat the patients and let the healthy stay healthy&quot;. The investigators intend with this&#xD;
      strategy to improve not only cardiovascular outcome among patients with T2DM, but also their&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Inten-CT study is an investigator-initiated open-label event-driven randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial including patients with T2DM stratified according to screen detected coronary artery&#xD;
      calcification. The investigators expect inclusion of 7300 patients in 2 years and a mean&#xD;
      follow-up period of 5 years.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESES Intensified multifactorial treatment is superior to standard treatment in patients&#xD;
      with CAC score ≥100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Less intensive multifactorial treatment is non-inferior to standard treatment in patients&#xD;
      with CAC =0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS Primary aim 1: Cardiovascular benefit In patients identified with high cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk as indicated by a CAC score ≥100, the investigators aim to compare the effect of&#xD;
      intensified multifactorial treatment versus standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim 2: Cardiovascular safety In patients identified with low cardiovascular risk as&#xD;
      indicated by a CAC score of zero, the investigators aim to compare the effect of less&#xD;
      intensive multifactorial treatment versus standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim 1: Patient-reported outcomes the investigators aim to compare patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes in the CAC-based treatment group and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome: Quality adjusted life years (QALY) using data from the EQ-5D questionnaire&#xD;
      and Danish preference weights of the normal population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims 2: Cost-Effectiveness The investigators aim to compare costs and outcomes&#xD;
      between the two groups after study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims 3: Treatment The investigators aim to quantify and compare the protocol-driven&#xD;
      and symptom-driven diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions between the intervention&#xD;
      groups and control groups during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to evaluate the adherence and efficacy of the therapeutic interventions&#xD;
      in the intervention groups and the control groups during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims 5: Screening The investigators aim to evaluate the association of CAC score&#xD;
      and coronary CT angiography derived measures of coronary atherosclerosis burden,&#xD;
      respectively, and CVD prognosis in patients with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to explore the association between CAC score, coronary CT angiography&#xD;
      derived measures of coronary atherosclerosis burden and echocardiography derived measures of&#xD;
      systolic/diastolic function. Specifically, the investigators aim to explore the ability of&#xD;
      echocardiography to re-classify patients stratified by CAC and coronary CT angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims 6: Biomarkers The investigators aim to explore the association between CAC&#xD;
      score, biochemical markers of inflammation and atherosclerosis (blood high-sensitivity&#xD;
      C-reactive protein, IL-1ß, IL-6, sE-selectin, sICAM-1, sVCAM, osteopontin, osteoprotegrin and&#xD;
      urinary proteomic risk classifier CKD273, CAD258, ACSP75, and HF1), and CVD prognosis in&#xD;
      patients with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Design The Steno Inten-CT study is an investigator-initiated pragmatic open-label&#xD;
      event-driven randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, a cardiac CT scan is performed in all participants. Next, patients are randomized to&#xD;
      either continue standard diabetes treatment blinded to CT scan and CAC results or receive&#xD;
      CAC-based treatment. Patients randomized to CAC-based treatment, will be stratified into low-&#xD;
      or high-risk patients (defined by CAC score &lt;100 or ≥ 100), and hence, allocated to two&#xD;
      parallel clinical studies. High-risk patients in the CAC-based treatment group will be&#xD;
      included in a study in which they will receive information on CAC-score, mandatory treatment&#xD;
      with dapagliflozin and semaglutide (both study drugs), and advise on further multifactorial&#xD;
      treatment of blood lipid levels, blood pressure and antithrombotic therapy. Low-risk patients&#xD;
      will be included in a study in which they receive advise on a potential downgrade in diabetes&#xD;
      treatment (CAC =0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CAC score 1-99 will be advised to follow contemporary guidelines in diabetes&#xD;
      treatment and will not be included in the primary analyses (Primary aims 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At End of Study (determined by an independent outcome committee), CVD event rates will be&#xD;
      compared between patients in the standard treatment group and the CAC-based treatment group,&#xD;
      stratified according to their CAC-level (CAC ≥100, and CAC=0)&#xD;
