  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess the feasibility of treatment by injecting botulinum toxin A&#xD;
      into the hand or foot of patients with signs of critical ischemia secondary to Buerger's&#xD;
      disease. The injection of botulinum toxin A is carried out at the end of a single session&#xD;
      during an hospitalization. Furthermore, tolerance and effects on the disease are evaluated at&#xD;
      1, 3 and 6 months post injections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buerger's disease or obliterate thromboangiitis(TAO) is a rare disease. It is an&#xD;
      inflammatory, segmental and occlusive disease affecting small and medium caliber arteries and&#xD;
      veins in the extremities of the limbs. It mainly affects young men, who traditionally smoke,&#xD;
      before the age of 45. There is currently no specific treatment for Buerger's disease.&#xD;
      Surgical treatment is rarely feasible, due to distal and diffuse damage. Several studies have&#xD;
      evaluated the perivascular injection of botulinum toxin type A (BTX) in patients with severe&#xD;
      Raynaud syndromes linked to scleroderma, with promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies with BTX have shown reduced pain, improved tissue perfusion with laser doppler, and&#xD;
      healing of digital ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are treated with a single session with botulinum toxin A injections during an&#xD;
      hospital visit, and the judgmental criteria are assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months post&#xD;
      injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injections are made at 4 injection points at the palmar or distal plantar fold, at the&#xD;
      level of the neurovascular beams, 2h after topical anesthesia by lidocaine cream under&#xD;
      occlusion, associated or not with nitrous oxide inhaled at the time of the injections (BOTOX®&#xD;
      100 U, botulinum toxin A injections in each hand or foot, for a final dose of 50 U (1 ml) per&#xD;
      extremity).&#xD;
