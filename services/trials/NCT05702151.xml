      Patients undergoing cardiac robotic surgery will receive different pain management after&#xD;
      being randomized in 2 groups. Control group will receive standard of care pain management&#xD;
      with acetaminophen and morphine in PCA pump, and the intervention group will receive an&#xD;
      erector spinae plane block with a continous infusion of local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 months the patients will be contacted to assess for pain and ask them for they life&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing cardiac robotic surgery will receive different pain management after&#xD;
      being randomized in 2 groups. Before the surgery and after checking eligibility criteria and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria the patients will be asked to enroll to the study. If the agree to&#xD;
      participate, they will sign de informed consent and fill the EQL 5D-5L questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of the surgery, the perioperative process will be performed as usual unless the&#xD;
      interventions detailed in this description.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be transferred to the surgical area, enter to the operating room, monitored and&#xD;
      general anesthesia will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard postoperative analgesia group will receive a at the end of the surgery a bolus of IV&#xD;
      morphine 0,05mg/kg, followed with infusion of IV morphine 0,25mg/h in Patient Controlled&#xD;
      Analgesia protocol (extra bolus on demand of 1mg with lockout interval 20 minutes), and&#xD;
      paracetamol 1g every 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group will receive the standard analgesia and an ESP Block. In this group,&#xD;
      after the induction of general anesthesia in the operating room, the patient is positioned in&#xD;
      lateral decubitus. Under strict aseptic conditions, and guided by ultrasound, an ipsilateral&#xD;
      Erector Spinae Plane block is performed injecting ropivacaine 0.2% 20ml, and a catheter is&#xD;
      placed in this plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An infusion of ropivacaine 0.16% at 10ml/h is started in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups of patients will emerge from anesthesia in the operative room or at the intensive&#xD;
      care unit in the first 6 postoperative hours if possible. After the surgery they will be&#xD;
      transfered to the intensive care unit where vital signs will be monitored continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain intensity and the total required opioid dose will be registered at 12, 24 and 48&#xD;
      postoperative hours. After acute phase of postoperative pain and typically until chest&#xD;
      drainages are retired, the ESP catheter and the IV morphine will be withdrawn. After&#xD;
      discharge by usual criteria, 3 months after the surgery patients will be contacted by&#xD;
      telephone. Quality of life, pain and if present, its characteristics will be assessed.&#xD;
