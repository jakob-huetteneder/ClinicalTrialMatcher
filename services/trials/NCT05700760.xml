    <textblock>
      The Reach Out, Stand Strong, Essentials for New Mothers (ROSE) program is an evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention that prevents half of cases of postpartum depression and was one of two&#xD;
      interventions recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force in 2019. All effectiveness&#xD;
      trials of ROSE and of the other recommended PPD prevention intervention included only&#xD;
      low-income women a single risk factor that doubles incidence of PPD. Thus, the existing&#xD;
      evidence base for PPD prevention consists primarily of women at increased risk for PPD. Based&#xD;
      on data from the PIs' current implementation study of ROSE, many healthcare and community&#xD;
      agencies in this implementation trial (78%) find it is more feasible for them to provide or&#xD;
      offer ROSE to every woman as part of their standard workflow, than it is to create a&#xD;
      screening and referral process for at risk women. In addition to being more feasible for&#xD;
      agencies, universal prevention may also be advantageous because the cost of a screening false&#xD;
      negative (resulting in a preventable case of PPD; $32,000) far exceeds the cost of ROSE&#xD;
      delivery ($50-$300/woman). Effectiveness of ROSE among low-income women at risk for PPD is&#xD;
      known (ROSE prevents ~50% of PPD cases). To inform a recommendation about using ROSE as&#xD;
      universal vs. selective or indicated prevention, we need to determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      ROSE among general populations of women, including women screening negative for PPD risk.&#xD;
      Thus, this project will assess ROSE effectiveness across PPD risk levels and across&#xD;
      prevention approaches in a sample of 2,320 women from a large regional health system (based&#xD;
      in Detroit, MI). Each proposed aim gathers a piece of information missing that is needed to&#xD;
      guide decision-making about ROSE as universal prevention. We will assess ROSE as universal,&#xD;
      selective, and indicated prevention in terms of: (1) ROSE effectiveness relative to a control&#xD;
      for each prevention approach in preventing PPD and improving functioning; (2) cost outcome,&#xD;
      (3) equity and (4) scalability of each prevention approach; and (5) mechanisms of ROSE&#xD;
      effects across PPD risk levels. We will integrate results to advise about ROSE as universal&#xD;
      prevention. This definitive PPD prevention trial will show how best to get an evidence-based&#xD;
      program to those who need it in settings where they receive perinatal care by addressing a&#xD;
      pragmatic and novel question (should ROSE be universal prevention?) and by examining equity&#xD;
      and cost-outcome of universal vs. other prevention approaches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2019, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a recommendation indicating&#xD;
      that it is possible to prevent postpartum depression through counseling interventions. The&#xD;
      Reach Out, Stand Strong, Essentials for New Mothers (ROSE) program was one of the two&#xD;
      interventions mentioned by name serving as a basis for the recommendation. ROSE was tested in&#xD;
      4 randomized trials in community prenatal settings with racially/ethnically diverse&#xD;
      low-income adult pregnant women and prevented ~50% postpartum depression (PPD) cases. ROSE is&#xD;
      scalable in that: (1) it does not require mental health clinicians or licensed providers of&#xD;
      any kind; (2) it has a flexible delivery structure (e.g., group vs. individual, timing during&#xD;
      pregnancy); (3) it is the shorter (5 vs. 8-17 sessions) of the two interventions described in&#xD;
      the USPSTF report. PIs Johnson and Zlotnick (the developer of ROSE) are in Year 4 of an&#xD;
      implementation trial examining how much technical support is needed for various kinds of&#xD;
      agencies to implement and sustain ROSE over time (R01 MH114883). That trial enrolled 98&#xD;
      agencies serving low income women nationally (i.e., settings where women receive perinatal&#xD;
      care), including prenatal clinics, home visiting, Healthy Start, and doula groups, among&#xD;
      others. It answers many of the questions posed in this RFA, including identifying: (1) a&#xD;
      &quot;service-ready efficacious preventive intervention&quot; that is &quot;scalable and can be delivered&#xD;
      with fidelity by setting providers;&quot; (2) &quot;strategies to train providers and support delivery&#xD;
      of evidence-based approaches with fidelity across health care and community settings;&quot; (3)&#xD;
      implementation barriers and facilitators; and (4) effective implementation strategies.&#xD;
      However, that trial raised a question about the USPSTF recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Universal vs. selective or indicated prevention. All effectiveness trials of ROSE and of the&#xD;
      other recommended PPD prevention intervention included only low-income women, a single risk&#xD;
      factor that doubles incidence of PPD. Three of the 4 ROSE trials included women who were&#xD;
      screened for additional risk for PPD per the Cooper survey to maximize trial power. Because&#xD;
      the existing evidence base consisted of women at increased risk for PPD, the USPSTF&#xD;
      recommendation suggested that &quot;clinicians provide or referâ€¦ persons who are at increased risk&#xD;
      of perinatal depression to counseling interventions,&quot; and called for &quot;more studies on the use&#xD;
      of tools for risk assessment.&quot; However, most of the healthcare and community agencies in our&#xD;
      implementation trial (78%) provide or offer ROSE to every woman as part of their standard&#xD;
      work flow (i.e., provide it as universal prevention), finding this more feasible than&#xD;
      creating a screening and referral process for indicated or selective prevention. Most of the&#xD;
      other agencies use provider judgment to refer to ROSE. Only 7% use a screening tool&#xD;
      (typically the Edinburgh) for ROSE referral. In addition to being more feasible, universal&#xD;
      prevention may be better because: (1) the cost of a screening false negative (resulting in a&#xD;
      preventable case of PPD; $32,000) far exceeds the cost of ROSE delivery ($50-300/woman); (2)&#xD;
      women who already face societal stigma (racial/ethnic minorities, undocumented) can be&#xD;
      fearful about consequences and feel further stigmatized when a screener singles them out as&#xD;
      needing PPD prevention. This project assesses effectiveness, cost-outcome, equity, and&#xD;
      scalability of using ROSE as universal vs. selective or indicated prevention for PPD using&#xD;
      commonly available/existing screening tools. We expect universal prevention to be optimal.&#xD;
      Effectiveness of ROSE among low-income women at risk for PPD is known (ROSE prevents ~50% of&#xD;
      PPD cases). To inform a recommendation about using ROSE as universal vs. selective or&#xD;
      indicated prevention, we need to determine the effectiveness of ROSE among all pregnant&#xD;
      persons, including those screening negative for PPD risk (defined in various ways; Section&#xD;
      A6). We will enroll 2,320 people receiving prenatal care in a large regional health system&#xD;
      (based in Detroit, MI), assess them with PPD risk tools (chosen for ease of use, wide use, or&#xD;
      availability in electronic health records), randomize everyone to ROSE or to enhanced care as&#xD;
      usual (ECAU), and collect information needed to inform a decision about ROSE as universal PPD&#xD;
      prevention. Each proposed aim gathers a piece of information missing in the USPSTF report to&#xD;
      guide decision-making. We will assess ROSE as universal, selective, and indicated prevention&#xD;
      in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ROSE effectiveness relative to ECAU for each prevention approach for (i) SCID5 major&#xD;
           depressive episode (primary) and (ii) functioning in the 6 months after birth. We will&#xD;
           explore effects between baseline and birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cost-outcome comparison of universal vs. selective or indicated prevention in terms of&#xD;
           PPD and functioning. Because it prevents costly false negatives, universal prevention is&#xD;
           almost always cost-beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Equity: (a) Percent false negative screens for minority vs. non-Hispanic white women;&#xD;
           (b) minority status as a moderator of outcome across risk levels; (c) PPD cases that&#xD;
           would be prevented by ROSE as universal prevention that would not be prevented under&#xD;
           selective/indicated for minority vs. non-Hispanic white women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Scalability as indicated by: (a) cost-outcome comparison of universal vs. indicated&#xD;
           prevention (Aim 2); (b) a scalability measure and qualitative interviews with the 98&#xD;
           agencies in the past ROSE implementation trial about how they decided on universal vs.&#xD;
           some other kind of prevention and how it went in their settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mechanisms of ROSE effects across PPD risk levels. We will integrate results to advise&#xD;
           about ROSE as universal prevention. This study fits the RFA by assessing how best to get&#xD;
           an evidence-based program to those who need it in settings where they receive perinatal&#xD;
           care, by addressing a pragmatic and novel question (should ROSE be universal&#xD;
           prevention?), and by examining equity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Innovation B1. This will be the first fully-powered RCT to assess universal vs. selective&#xD;
      or indicated prevention of an evidence-based intervention for PPD in terms of prevention of&#xD;
      PPD cases. The USPSTF recommendation on prevention of postpartum depression (i.e., that&#xD;
      &quot;clinicians provide or refer pregnant and postpartum women who are at increased risk of&#xD;
      perinatal depression to counseling interventions&quot;) is new (2019) and was limited to women at&#xD;
      elevated risk for PPD because that is what the evidence to date consisted of (i.e., trials&#xD;
      among women at elevated risk for PPD). However, our current 98-agency implementation trial&#xD;
      and other factors suggest that universal prevention may be more scalable, cost-effective, and&#xD;
      equitable than selective or indicated prevention for PPD. This trial will be the first to&#xD;
      examine the advisability of universal vs. selective or indicated PPD prevention (a) at all, &amp;&#xD;
      (b) with respect to equity, scalability, and comparative cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B2. This definitive trial will be the largest PPD prevention trial to date. Among other&#xD;
      advantages, this provides better power than previous studies to examine race/ethnicity by&#xD;
      intervention interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B3. This trial will be the first to explore ROSE as antenatal depression (AD) prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B4. EPDS as a predictor of future PPD. The EPDS is a well-validated and almost ubiquitously&#xD;
      used measure of perinatal depressive symptoms and it makes sense that elevated symptoms&#xD;
      likely predict future disorder. However, no previous study has ever tested the EPDS as a&#xD;
      predictor of future development of full PPD (only its correlation with current disorder),&#xD;
      despite being used this way in clinical practice. A bonus additional feature of this trial is&#xD;
      that we can use the control condition (n~1,160) to evaluate the predictive validity of this&#xD;
      commonly used measure. Currently, no AD symptom measure has been validated as a predictor of&#xD;
      PPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B5. Scalability is a relatively understudied area of implementation science. This study will&#xD;
      provide the first (quantitative and qualitative) analysis of scalability of universal,&#xD;
      selective, and indicated PPD prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: Research Design This project informs use of ROSE as universal vs. selective or&#xD;
      indicated prevention for PPD by assessing: (1) ROSE effectiveness for each prevention&#xD;
      approach among 2,320 women in terms of (i) SCID5 major depressive episode in the 6 months&#xD;
      after birth (primary), and (ii) functioning. (2) Cost-outcome comparison of universal vs.&#xD;
      selective or indicated prevention in terms of PPD and functioning (equation in Section&#xD;
      D2.11). Savings from preventing false negatives (PPD cases among &quot;low risk&quot; women) drives&#xD;
      this comparison. (3) Equity: (a) percent false negative screens for minority vs. non-Hispanic&#xD;
      white women; (b) minority status as a moderator of outcome across risk levels; (c) PPD cases&#xD;
      that would be prevented by ROSE as universal prevention that would not be prevented under&#xD;
      selective/indicated for minority vs. non-Hispanic white women. (4) Scalability of universal&#xD;
      vs. other kinds of prevention as indicated by: (a) cost-outcome analyses (Aim 2); (b) a&#xD;
      scalability measure and qualitative interviews with the 98 agencies in the ROSE&#xD;
      implementation trial. (5) Mechanisms of ROSE effects across PPD risk levels.&#xD;
