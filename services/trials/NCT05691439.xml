      This research will use biobehavioral approaches to generate understanding about the linkages&#xD;
      between sleep duration and timing, stressful life events, and depressive symptoms in&#xD;
      adolescents, with a long-term aim of developing effective preventative interventions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The last decade witnessed a steady growth from 8% to 14% in the prevalence of adolescents&#xD;
      suffering from major depressive episode within the past year, and depression is expected to&#xD;
      be the leading cause of global disability by 2030. The increase in depression incidence and&#xD;
      disability is also related to increases in suicidality in adolescents, and the depressive&#xD;
      symptom of anhedonia predicts suicidality above and beyond depression diagnosis. The high&#xD;
      degree of morbidity and mortality associated with depression and anhedonia in adolescence&#xD;
      makes this a key developmental period for research and intervention. Risk for depression and&#xD;
      anhedonia is elevated in adolescents with insufficient sleep duration, late sleep timing, or&#xD;
      elevated exposure to stressors. Alarmingly, only 30% of adolescents regularly obtain the&#xD;
      recommended hours of sleep, and sleep timing is at its latest during mid- to&#xD;
      late-adolescence. Adolescents also report high levels of stress related to work- and&#xD;
      time-demands, and most will experience at least one major adverse life event before&#xD;
      adulthood. Short/late sleep and stressors may also cause disruptions in reward- and&#xD;
      stress-related brain function (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex response to monetary reward,&#xD;
      autonomic and endocrine function during stressors), which are key biobehavioral mechanisms of&#xD;
      depression and anhedonia. Short/late sleep habits are prime targets for depression&#xD;
      intervention in adolescents; however, there is insufficient causal evidence that improving&#xD;
      sleep opportunity and/or timing will alter the biobehavioral mechanisms of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this R01 is to evaluate a biobehavioral model whereby sufficient&#xD;
      sleep duration and/or early sleep timing can reduce depressive symptoms and anhedonia by&#xD;
      promoting reward- and stress-related brain function in adolescents. The long-term goal of&#xD;
      this research is to leverage sleep and circadian function to promote mental health. A series&#xD;
      of studies by the PI and Co-Is indicate that short sleep, late sleep, and stressful life&#xD;
      events independently predict reward- and stress-related brain function and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in adolescents. However, these studies do not evaluate the interactive effects of&#xD;
      sleep/circadian function and stressful life events, or use experimental designs. More recent&#xD;
      research by the PI and Co-Is uses sleep-circadian manipulation to target reward- and&#xD;
      stress-related brain function and improve mental health in adolescents. Building from this&#xD;
      research, this R01 will test the central hypothesis that extending and/or advancing sleep&#xD;
      will alter reward- and stress-related brain function, and decrease depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      anhedonia, in adolescents with short and late sleep. This proposal is consistent with the&#xD;
      NIMH Strategic Objective to identify clinically meaningful biomarkers and behavioral&#xD;
      indicators of mental health.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pediatric Depression Scale - Short Form (8-item)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scale for Depression (8-item short form) will be administered at baseline, after each 2-week interval of intensive monitoring, and at follow-up, in reference to the past 7 days. The measure uses 5-point Likert scales, with scores ranging from 8 to 40 and higher scores indicating higher depression and lower scores indicating better outcome. Raw scores are converted to standardized T-scores using conversion tables published on the PROMIS website (nihpromis.org). T-scores of 50 represent the mean of the standardized sample.</description>

    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)scale for Positive Affect (8-item short form) will be administered at baseline, after each 2-week interval of intensive monitoring, and at follow-up, in reference to the past 7 days. The measure uses 5-point Likert scales, with scores ranging from 8 to 40 and higher scores indicating higher positive affect and better outcome. Raw scores are converted to standardized T-scores using conversion tables published on the PROMIS website (nihpromis.org). T-scores of 50 represent the mean of the standardized sample.</description>

    <measure>Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS) will be used to assess state anhedonia related to 4 domains: hobbies, food/drink, social activities, and sensory experience. The 17-item measure assesses hedonic experiences &quot;right now&quot; using 4-point Likert scales. The DARS has high reliability and good convergent and divergent validity. The DARS scores range from 0 to 68, with higher scores indicating lower anhedonia and better outcome.</description>

    <description>fMRI during the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task will be used to measure BOLD regional response and functional connectivity related to anticipation and receipt of monetary rewards. This task reliably elicits activation in neural reward circuitry and is sensitive to depression and sleep/circadian factors.</description>

    <measure>Stress-related brain function</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Stress-related brain function will be indexed using autonomic and neuroendocrine measures taken before and during the Trier Social Stress Task (TSST). The TSST is a lab-based social-evaluative threat task that reliably elicits subjective stress and increases in the stress-hormone cortisol.</description>

    <description>Participants in the sleep extension and advance condition will maintain a stable sleep schedule that extends sleep duration and advances bedtime by 90 min relative to weekday bedtime. This chronotherapeutic manipulation will include blocking phase-delaying light in the evening using goggles with orange lenses (&quot;blue blockers&quot;) beginning 2 h prior to bedtime, and 30 min of 506 lux blue-green light exposure in the morning beginning at rise time using bright light goggles (ReTimer Pty Ltd., Australia). Schedule and chronotherapy adherence will be reinforced using motivational techniques (e.g., securing motivation, preplanning, problem-solving), requiring participants to text the study coordinator and complete morning assessments at rise time, and monetary incentives.</description>
