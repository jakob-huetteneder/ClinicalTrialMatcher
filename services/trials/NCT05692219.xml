  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposed pilot randomized controlled trial is to examine the efficacy&#xD;
      of self-help multicomponent lifestyle medicine intervention and cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      relative to a wait-list control group for alleviating depressive symptoms among Hong Kong&#xD;
      Chinese adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will serve as a pioneering attempt to investigate the comparative efficacy of&#xD;
      self-help multicomponent lifestyle medicine intervention and cognitive behavioral therapy for&#xD;
      reducing depressive symptoms. The proposed study will pave the way for future intervention&#xD;
      development and provide the evidence base for the integration of lifestyle-based&#xD;
      interventions into the current treatment model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to all study procedures, eligible participants will be required to complete an online&#xD;
      informed consent via an in-house smartphone application, Longitudinax Pro. Around 90 eligible&#xD;
      participants aged 18 or above with a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 total score of 10 or&#xD;
      higher will be randomly assigned to either self-help multicomponent lifestyle medicine&#xD;
      intervention (LM), self-help CBT (CBT), or the waitlist control group (WL) in a ratio of&#xD;
      1:1:1 by an independent statistician. Participants in the LM and CBT groups will receive a&#xD;
      booklet-delivered multicomponent lifestyle medicine intervention and CBT for depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, respectively. Both interventions comprise 6 weekly 60-minute sessions and daily&#xD;
      homework activities according to instructions in the booklet (details can be found in &quot;Arms&#xD;
      and Interventions&quot;). For both LM and CBT groups, a follow-up phone call (approximately 15&#xD;
      minutes) will be made every two weeks to encourage participants to adhere to the&#xD;
      intervention. Participants in the WL group will be asked to maintain their typical activities&#xD;
      during the trial period, and they will be given access to either the booklet-delivered&#xD;
      multicomponent lifestyle medicine intervention or booklet-delivered CBT following the 3-month&#xD;
      post-intervention follow-up. The primary outcome of interest will be depressive symptoms. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will include anxiety symptoms, perceived insomnia severity,&#xD;
      health-promoting behaviors, quality of life, functional impairment, and intervention&#xD;
      evaluation at immediate post-intervention and 3-month follow-up assessments.&#xD;

    <description>The PHQ-9, a 9-item questionnaire used for screening, diagnosing, monitoring, and measuring the severity of depression, which scores each of the nine DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day).</description>

    <measure>Change in the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention, and 3-month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>ISI is a 7-item scale designed to evaluate perceived insomnia severity. Ratings on the 5-point Likert scale are obtained on the perceived severity of sleep-onset, sleep-maintenance, early morning awakening problems, satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, noticeably of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and level of distress caused by the sleep problem.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Short Form (Six-Dimension) Health Survey (SF-6D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention, and 3-month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>SF-6D is a preference-based single index measure of health. A six-digit number represents each SF-6D health state, each digit denotes the level of one of six SF-6D dimensions: physical functioning, role limitation, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, and vitality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Short Multidimensional Inventory Lifestyle Evaluation (SMILE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention, and 3-month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The SMILE is a 43-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure 7 aspects of lifestyle, which included diet and nutrition (7-item), substance use (4-item), exercise (3-item), stress management (10-item), sleep management (5- item), social support (10-item), and environmental exposures (4-item). Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale. The possible response categories of each item are always (4), several days (3), seldom (2), and never (1). For items 3-4, 8-11, 21, 29, and 40-41, they will be reverse scored. The total score of a lifestyle aspect equals the sum of the respected item score, while the overall lifestyle pattern score can be calculated by summing up the 43-item scores. The higher the score, the better the lifestyle pattern.</description>
