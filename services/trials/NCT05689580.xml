    <textblock>
      The study investigates the dietary habits in relation to low doses of omega-3 fatty acids in&#xD;
      subcutaneous adipose tissue, disease activity and atherosclerosis. The low intake of omega-3&#xD;
      and high intake of carbohydrate among patients with SLE appear to be associated with worse&#xD;
      disease activity, adverse serum lipids and plaque presence.Three-month-old mice received an&#xD;
      injection of pristane or saline solution and were fed with different experimental diets:&#xD;
      sunflower oil diet or extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) diet. After 24 weeks, mice were&#xD;
      sacrificed, spleens were collected and kidneys were removed for immunoinflammatory&#xD;
      detections. The study have demonstrated that EVOO diet significantly reduced renal damage and&#xD;
      decreased cytokine: TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17 production.The ketogenic diet utilizes a&#xD;
      high fat, adequate protein, low carbohydrate diet that control type of food and exchange. The&#xD;
      aim of the present study that ketogenic diet treated in SLE patients may decrease overactive&#xD;
      immunity and associated inflammatory markers.&#xD;

      This study was conducted in patients with lupus nephritis at outpatient department, who are&#xD;
      1.more than 20 years old, 2. can accept these dietary intervention and fill out 《20200909&#xD;
      version4》 the consent, 3. Satisfy at least four criteria according to 1997 American College&#xD;
      of Rheumatology Classification Criteria, 4. Under maintenance stage of disease and have more&#xD;
      than 1gm of daily proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These enrollees will be assigned into two groups randomly. For Group 1, subjects will be&#xD;
      educated by dietitian and receive two months of ketogenic diet. Then, followed by three&#xD;
      months of washout period. Finally, they will receive dietary education and follow balanced&#xD;
      diet for two months. For Group2, subjects will receive dietary education and follow balanced&#xD;
      diet for two months first, then followed by three months of washout period. At last, they&#xD;
      will receive dietary education of ketogenic diet and need to follow the ketogenic diet for&#xD;
      two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Ketogenic diet (2months) and balanced diet (2months) period, subjects were&#xD;
      separately assessed with nutritional status evaluation and laboratory data follow-up for 4&#xD;
      times (Day1, 1st week, 1st month, 2nd month). During the 8 times visits , anthropometric,&#xD;
      age, sex, height, weight, BMI, muscle girdle measurements, biochemical measurements, serum&#xD;
      albumin, blood urea nitrogen, hemoglobin, and electrolyte, nitrogen balance, and medical&#xD;
      records are evaluated. The course of the trial to medium-chain triglyceride lipid intervening&#xD;
      50-70% of dietary intake, the first day of consumption of 1/3 amount of medium chain fat, if&#xD;
      no adverse adaptation, an increase of 1/3 volume until the full amount of intervening&#xD;
      nutrition The division is responsible for designing menus that contain information on how to&#xD;
      purchase special dietary formulas, calculate and cook, and possibly prepare food for future&#xD;
      problem solving. Results were presented as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed&#xD;
      using SPSS software version 21.0. Difference in patients' dietary intake and biochemical&#xD;
      values were compared for the significant differences at&#xD;
&#xD;
      1st, 2th month using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Comparison of male and female&#xD;
      baseline characteristics were using by unpaired t-test.&#xD;
