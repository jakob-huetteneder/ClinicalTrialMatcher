  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to advance the understanding of underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      impacting performance fatigability and perceived fatigability in Veterans with post-COVID-19&#xD;
      fatigue and explore the safety and feasibility of a home-based &quot;minimal-dose&quot; resistance&#xD;
      exercise program in this population. The central hypothesis is that declines in force&#xD;
      capacity, skeletal muscle oxygen extraction, and affective responses to physical activity&#xD;
      offer potential mechanisms through which fatigability is increased in Veterans with&#xD;
      post-COVID-19 fatigue. Moreover, home-based resistance exercise delivered remotely may&#xD;
      provide a safe and feasibility treatment option for targeting neuromuscular and&#xD;
      neurobehavioral factors influencing fatigability severity in this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical case definition of post-COVID-19 condition (also referred to as Long COVID) as&#xD;
      defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) includes individuals with a history of&#xD;
      probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with&#xD;
      symptoms and that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative&#xD;
      diagnosis. Fatigue represents one of the most frequently reported symptoms in individuals&#xD;
      experiencing post-COVID-19 (i.e., post-COVID-19 fatigue; PCF).Fatigue is shown to persist for&#xD;
      months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, negatively impacting activities of daily living. For the&#xD;
      purposes of this SPiRE proposal, fatigue is operationally defined as a state characteristic&#xD;
      encompassing a subjective lack of physical and/or mental energy that is perceived by the&#xD;
      individual to interfere with usual or desired activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased fatigability is a possible complication following SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the&#xD;
      presence of both neuromuscular and neurobiological consequences. Skeletal muscle alterations&#xD;
      including reduced force capacity, fiber atrophy, mitochondria and metabolic dysfunction, and&#xD;
      capillary impairments have been observed in patients following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Autopsy&#xD;
      reports of patients who died after SARS-CoV-2 infection found evidence of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      atrophy of type 2 fibers, necrotizing myopathy, and myositis. Similarly, using nerve&#xD;
      conduction studies, patients with long-term COVID-19 were found to have signs of myopathy,&#xD;
      even those who were not hospitalized. Evidence from cardiopulmonary exercise testing in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19 has revealed impaired skeletal muscle oxygen extraction, as&#xD;
      opposed to central limitations (i.e., cardiac output), as a determinant of exercise&#xD;
      intolerance. In addition to neuromuscular complications, SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been&#xD;
      shown to be associated with psychiatric sequelae. Collectively, these findings underscore&#xD;
      neuromuscular as well as neurobiological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 as potential independent&#xD;
      or co-occurring mechanisms by which increased fatigability occurs and persists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite widespread calls for the importance of rehabilitation in individuals recovering from&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, little progress has been made regarding the potential benefits of&#xD;
      physical exercise on fatigue and fatigability in this population. Moreover, concerns have&#xD;
      been raised about the applicability of physical exercise in patients recovering from&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example, while the health and functional benefits of exercise are&#xD;
      vast and widely known, in certain patient populations exertion is shown to exacerbate symptom&#xD;
      severity. Some individuals with PCF may report experiencing worsening of symptoms after&#xD;
      physical or mental exertion. Home-based exercise may offer an appealing option for those&#xD;
      individuals concerned about attending community fitness facilities. Home-based exercise is&#xD;
      shown to produced moderate effects on muscle strength and balance. Presently, the exact&#xD;
      dosing of home-based exercise to elicit positive outcomes in fatigability is unknown.&#xD;
      Minimal-dose resistance exercise has been proposed as a potential strategy for improving&#xD;
      neuromuscular characteristics and physical function. Minimal-dose resistance exercise uses&#xD;
      little to no equipment with exercises performed at lower workloads. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      adapt the &quot;minimal-dose&quot; resistance exercise paradigm to a remote home-based resistance&#xD;
      exercise program for Veterans with PCF to determine its implications for reducing&#xD;
      fatigability and improving neuromuscular and neurobiological factors. Minimal-dose resistance&#xD;
      exercise for the proposed application is defined as a single, weekly body-weight exercise&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
