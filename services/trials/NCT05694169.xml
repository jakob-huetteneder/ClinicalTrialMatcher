  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of supplemental REACT injections in&#xD;
      participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who have previously received REACT treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 1, Open-label trial where up to 10 participants will enroll in the trial after parent&#xD;
      REACT protocol EOS visit completion. Participants may undergo a biopsy to manufacture REACT&#xD;
      if additional biopsy tissue is required. Participants will receive 2 REACT injections into&#xD;
      contralateral kidneys separated by 3 months. All participants will be followed for 12 months&#xD;
      post last supplemental REACT injection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The participant has received REACT in a previous trial for treatment of chronic kidney&#xD;
             disease and completed their parent protocol follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The participant is male or female, 30 to 80 years of age on the date of informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The participant has a documented clinical diagnosis of an eGFR greater than or equal&#xD;
             to 14 and less than or equal to 50 mL/min/1.73m2, not requiring renal dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The participant has stable blood pressure and is maintained on a stable&#xD;
             antihypertensive medication regimen if treatment for hypertension is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The participant has a history of renal transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The participant has received dialysis for more than 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The participant has received any other investigational products after completion of&#xD;
             REACT injections within 3 months of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The participant has a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) of greater than 5,000&#xD;
             mg/g.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The participant has hemoglobin levels less than 10 g/dL and is not responsive to the&#xD;
             standard medical intervention for CKD-related anemia prior to screening.&#xD;
