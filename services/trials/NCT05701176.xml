  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      [18F]F-AraG is a promising tracer to image activated T-cells with positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET). The aim of the SHARP trial is to investigate changes in [18F]F-AraG uptake&#xD;
      following Anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of immunotherapy and patient selection for combinatorial immunotherapy&#xD;
      strategies would greatly improve if the tumor microenvironment (TME) could be characterized&#xD;
      more accurately. Positron emission tomography (PET) using tracers that target immune cell&#xD;
      subsets may provide a non-invasive means to immune profile the TME. Imaging T-cells can help&#xD;
      in identifying 'hot' tumors, or parts of the tumor mass that have high concentrations of&#xD;
      tumor infiltrating T-cells and also provide information on its activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising tracer to image activated T-cells is [18F]F-AraG. Based on the hypothesis that&#xD;
      [18F]F-AraG will accumulate in activated T-cells, it is expected that [18F]F-AraG and PET&#xD;
      will enable to identify tumors and tumor areas with high concentrations of tumor infiltrating&#xD;
      activated T-cells on pathological assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SHARP trial, participants receive 3 longitudinal [18F]F-AraG PET scans during&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 immunotherapy to explore the changes in uptake of [18F]F-AraG during the treatment.&#xD;
