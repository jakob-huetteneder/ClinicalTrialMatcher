  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely known that exercise creates structural and functional changes in the brain.&#xD;
      Synaptic plasticity develops through exercise, thus improving brain functions. It is&#xD;
      suggested that skeletal muscle contraction and peripheral signal molecules secreted from&#xD;
      various tissues, especially skeletal muscle, contribute to exercise's effect on the brain's&#xD;
      structure and function. These signals synthesized and released from skeletal muscle are&#xD;
      called myokines. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Cathepsin B are two of these&#xD;
      myokines, which have been reported to cross the blood-brain barrier following secretion in&#xD;
      the periphery and affect the structure and functions of the brain. Transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (TMS) allows to evaluate the synaptic plasticity responses of the motor cortex to&#xD;
      exercise, while cognitive function responses are evaluated via cognitive tests. Additionally,&#xD;
      exercise type and intensity influence the responses of cortical excitability and cognitive&#xD;
      function. This research proposal aims to investigate how acute high-intensity intermittent&#xD;
      exercise (HIIT) changes primary motor cortex (M1) excitability, M1-related cognitive&#xD;
      functions, and peripheral BDNF and Cathepsin B levels in healthy sedentary adults and to&#xD;
      investigate the relationship between these neurophysiological parameters. All parameters will&#xD;
      be measured before and after the acute exercise. M1 excitability will be evaluated through&#xD;
      resting motor threshold, short interval intracortical inhibition, and input-output curve&#xD;
      measurements. Cognitive functions will be evaluated through mental rotation and working&#xD;
      memory tasks, and peripheral signal responses will be measured by serum levels of BDNF and&#xD;
      Cathepsin B. Our hypotheses are: 1) Acute HIIT will increase peripheral BDNF and CTSB level,&#xD;
      cortical excitability, and M1-specific cognitive function performance. 2) M1 excitability,&#xD;
      cognitive function performance, and peripheral BDNF and CTSB increase will be related&#xD;
      following exercise. Our findings will have the potential to be a guide for the integration of&#xD;
      exercise into daily life and will provide cortical and peripheral data on the&#xD;
      neurophysiological basis of the relationship between exercise and cognition.&#xD;

      Participants Twenty-eight healthy young adults (female|male:14|14) aged 20-30 years will have&#xD;
      participated in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be at least undergraduate students, right-handed dominant, exercising &lt;150&#xD;
      minutes per week in the last six months. Before the experiment, the participants will be&#xD;
      evaluated for their background, family history, and whether they have any health complaints&#xD;
      that prevent them from exercising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the adult transcranial magnetic stimulation safety screening questionnaire, participants&#xD;
      in the risk group for brain stimulation, those with intracranial implants and&#xD;
      contraindications, and those with a history of any psychiatric or neurological disease,&#xD;
      seizures, any serious medical condition, or pregnancy will be excluded. The hand preference&#xD;
      questionnaire will evaluate hand preference, and physical activity status will be evaluated&#xD;
      by the short version of the international physical activity questionnaire. The&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness will be assessed with the graded maximal exercise stress test. The&#xD;
      N-back test is a continuous performance test used to assess working memory capacity. The&#xD;
      mental rotation test will evaluate the mental rotation score. The research team designed both&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation will be used to assess corticomotor excitability. Resting&#xD;
      Motor Threshold (RMT), Short Interval Intracortical Inhibition (SICI), and input-output curve&#xD;
      measurements will be performed on all participants in our study for the TMS study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BDNF and CTSB measurements of the participants will be made both at baseline and following&#xD;
      the acute exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIIT exercise lasting 23 minutes will be performed on the bicycle ergometer. Participants&#xD;
      will make 3 visits to the laboratory. First session: Cardiorespiratory fitness assessment,&#xD;
      all questionnaires. Second session: TMS analyses, cognitive assessments, HIIT, myokine&#xD;
      assessments Third session: TMS analyses, cognitive assessments, control (watching a nature&#xD;
      documentary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second and third sessions will be performed by cross-over design. Data analysis will be&#xD;
      performed with two-way repeated ANOVA to determine the effect of within-group factors&#xD;
      (control and HIIT) and time (PRE and POST) on corticospinal excitability and other&#xD;
      parameters. When the effect size was calculated as É³p2 &gt;0.26, the sample size was calculated&#xD;
      a priori as n = 22. Considering possible data losses, the number of participants was&#xD;
      determined as 28.&#xD;
