      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deafness is one of the nine potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia simulated by the&#xD;
      Lancet dementia Prevention, intervention and Care Committee in 2017. Some studies have found&#xD;
      that the risk factors of dementia in deafness system, with the increase of the degree of&#xD;
      deafness, the risk of cognitive decline increases, while after long-term wear of hearing&#xD;
      aids, the deterioration of immediate and delayed memory is less, and the possibility of&#xD;
      cognitive decline slows down. Therefore, it is necessary for us to improve the auditory&#xD;
      ability of patients with deafness through auditory intervention, so as to slow down its&#xD;
      effect on dementia and reduce the incidence of dementia. At present, auditory intervention&#xD;
      methods include hearing aid wearing and cochlear implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are few studies on cognitive function of presbycusis patients in China, and&#xD;
      there is no research on how many years of auditory intervention can effectively slow down the&#xD;
      incidence of dementia in presbycusis patients with MCI. Therefore, we intend to conduct a&#xD;
      prospective cohort study on the changes of cognitive function of presbycusis under hearing&#xD;
      aid intervention.&#xD;

      Materials and methods: The unicentric, prospective cohort study included 388 patients with&#xD;
      presbycusis aged 60-85 who were recruited in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology from March&#xD;
      2022 to March 2028. They were averagely divided into the control group (n = 194) and the&#xD;
      intervention group (n = 194). The post intervention group received hearing aid intervention,&#xD;
      and was followed up for 5 years, once every six months. Audiological assessment, cognitive&#xD;
      function assessment, noninvasive brain imaging assessment and hearing aid effect assessment&#xD;
      were performed at baseline and each follow-up. This thesis aim to investigate the changes of&#xD;
      cognitive function in senile deafness under the intervention of hearing aids.&#xD;

    <description>Pure audiometry is to measure the air conduction hearing thresholds of 125Hz, 250Hz, 500Hz, 1000Hz, 2000Hz, 4000Hz and 8000Hz and bone conduction threshold of 500Hz, 1000Hz, 2000Hz and 4000Hz in normal people and deaf patients by Hughson-Westlake(HW) method, also gets the tested person's pure-tone average (PTA) in the hearing ear which is calculated using thresholds for 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz. The acoustic standard of the sound insulation room is GB/T16296, the reverberation time is (0.3±0.15) seconds, and the pure tone audiometer model is Interacoustics AC40(Inter-c AC40).</description>
