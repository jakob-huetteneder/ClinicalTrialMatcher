      EVLA is used in in treating refluxing veins, commonly the GSV. The tip of catheter is usually&#xD;
      placed 2-2.5 cm distal to the sapheno-femoral junction. This technique theoretically provides&#xD;
      the lowest risk for endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT).&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Chronic venous disease (CVD) is one of the most common pathologies in the&#xD;
      general population of adults in both industrialized and developing countries. the most severe&#xD;
      form of CVD is venous ulceration with an overall prevalence of about 1 % in the adult&#xD;
      population, which increases with age and is more common in women and obese patients. Venous&#xD;
      ulcers significantly impair quality of life, and their treatment places a heavy financial&#xD;
      burden upon healthcare systems. Varicose veins (VVs) is a common disease in adults, and VVs&#xD;
      without skin changes are present in about 20% of the population, while active ulcers are&#xD;
      found in 0.5%.The traditional surgical treatment of VVs is high ligation of the great&#xD;
      saphenous vein (GSV), axial stripping and phlebotomy, but the postoperative clinical&#xD;
      recurrence is as high as 60%.4 Minimally invasive techniques, such as endovenous laser&#xD;
      ablation (EVLA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), have become widely used for the treatment&#xD;
      of VVS. Several reports have shown Several reports have shown that endovenous techniques are&#xD;
      as effective as traditional procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVLA is used in in treating refluxing veins, commonly the GSV. The tip of catheter is usually&#xD;
      placed 2-2.5 cm distal to the sapheno-femoral junction. This technique theoretically provides&#xD;
      the lowest risk for endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study we aimed to evaluate the zero-distance technique (the kissing technique)&#xD;
      compared to 2-cm distance from SFJ valve in ablating incompetent GSV. Postoperative quality&#xD;
      of life (QoL) analysis was assessed using the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ) and&#xD;
      Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work: To compare laser therapy ablation of long saphenous vein reflux by&#xD;
      conventional and the kissing techniques on development of DVT, recurrence rate of VVs,&#xD;
      ulcer-free time, and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods Study location: The study will be conducted at the department of&#xD;
      vascular surgery in Mansoura University, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: Randomized Controlled Prospective study Study duration: 2 years: 2022-2024&#xD;
      Sample size: It will include all patients presented to our department fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study will be conducted in patients with Incompetent long saphenous&#xD;
      vein with and without ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Primary symptomatic VVS (CEAP, C3-C6), sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ)&#xD;
      incompetence, and GSV reflux from the groin to below the knee Exclusion criteria included;&#xD;
      history of venous surgery, suspected or proven deep venous thrombosis, history of DVT, reflux&#xD;
      of deep veins to distal limb, duplication of GSV, and patients' refusal to participate in the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: The demographics, symptoms, and preoperative clinical data will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History Data: including underlying medical conditions, any previous associated morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination: Venous examinations. Laboratory: Blood picture, Blood sugar level, Kidney&#xD;
      functions, Liver functions and Coagulation profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging: Duplex US Method of Randomization: Computer-based Therapies Conventional Technique:&#xD;
      Endogenous Laser Ablation (EVLA) uses a laser fibre, which is inserted into the refluxing&#xD;
      vein via skin puncture. Using 1470 nm laser and a radial fibre for less discomfort. The&#xD;
      catheter is placed 2-2.5 cm distal to the sapheno-femoral junction. Tumescence with a mixture&#xD;
      of 20 mL 2% lidocaine, 1: 200,000 adrenaline and 20 mL 0.5% levobupivacaine in 1 L of 0.9%&#xD;
      saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The kissing technique: The catheter is positioned exactly at the terminal valve of the SFJ&#xD;
      (kissing the valve).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for technical success will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Closed or absent GSV with absent reflux&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A re-canalized GSV or treatment failure will be defined as an open segment of the&#xD;
           treated vein segment of &gt;10 cm in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All patients are followed in outpatient's settings at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The operation time, number of punctures, intraoperative blood loss (determined by the&#xD;
           swabs weighed pre and postoperatively)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Recurrence of varicosities and any complications are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of Heat induced thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ecchymosis was confirmed 72 h after operation when the lividity and congestion area was&#xD;
           &gt;1 cm2 in the affected limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Skin burns were identified 72 h after operation when the skin was red and oedematous&#xD;
           according to the criteria for burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recurrence was defined by both duplex ultrasound and the clinical examination. A&#xD;
           varicose vein that had not been observed before or previously been marked by the patient&#xD;
           on the AVVQ form was considered to be a recurrent varicose vein (owing to&#xD;
           neo-vascularization or dilation of pre-existing veins).7,11&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sensory impairment (numbness) that occurred around incisions was recorded based on the&#xD;
           patient's history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QoL assessment The diseased relation effect on QoL was determined using the AVVQ (Chinese&#xD;
      version), which assessed the specific effect on QoL and was scored from 0 (no effect of VVS&#xD;
      on QoL) to a theoretical maximum of 100.8 The VCSS (Chinese version) was also completed (for&#xD;
      the VCSS, 0 represents no significant venous disease and 30 is the maximum score), which is a&#xD;
      valid sensitive and responsive measure of the severity of VVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Â· The data will be analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The numerical&#xD;
      outcomes e.g. age is calculated as mean. Gender will be recorded as frequency and percentage.&#xD;
      Chi Square test is applied to assess the association of various parameters. The results will&#xD;
      be considered statistically significant if the p-value is found to be less than or equal to&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
