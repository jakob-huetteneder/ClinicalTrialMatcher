  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase l, single arm, prospective open, dose-escalation study in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory CD19-positive B cell malignancies (ALL, NHL, CLL). The trial will&#xD;
      include adult and pediatric patients. There will be three individual cohorts, defined by&#xD;
      disease biology: pediatric ALL and aggressive pediatric NHL (Cohort 1), adult ALL (Cohort 2)&#xD;
      and adult NHL/CLL (Cohort 3).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will evaluate the safety of the MB-CART19.1 and determine the recommended dose levels for&#xD;
      the Phase II clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose evaluation will start in Cohorts 1 and 2 with Dose Level 1 (5x10e5 CAR T cells/Kg) and&#xD;
      in Cohort 3 with Dose Level 2 1x10e6 CAR T cells/Kg) , sparing Dose Level 1 . Each of the&#xD;
      cohorts will evaluate the safety of the CAR-T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each dose level of each of the three cohorts three 3 + 3 patients will be treated. A&#xD;
      particular dose level will be expanded to 6 patients if one patient out of 3 patients treated&#xD;
      at that particular dose level develops DLT. Once this occurs, further dose-escalations are&#xD;
      halted until the dose has proven to be safe in the expanded cohort. If 2 or more in a cohort&#xD;
      of 6 patients develop DLT no further dose escalation is allowed, and the next lower dose&#xD;
      level will be expanded to 6 patients in total. The highest dose among the dose levels tested&#xD;
      at which no more than one out of six patients experiences DLT will be considered the MTD. In&#xD;
      Dose Level 3, three additional patients will be treated, if no DLT occurred. Dose Level 0&#xD;
      will be tested only if Dose Level 1 is not tolerable.&#xD;

             untreated brain metastases/CNS disease will be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;

             cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary abnormalities or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because CAR-T cell&#xD;

             any bone marrow biopsy prior to initiation of therapy&#xD;

         13. Serious and/or potentially fatal medical conditions&#xD;

         16. Hypersensitivity against any drug or its ingredients/impurities that is scheduled or&#xD;
             likely to be given during trial participation, e.g. as part of the mandatory&#xD;

             therapies for treatment related toxicities;&#xD;
