  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In the interventional study of gender mainstreaming, few studies have been&#xD;
      conducted on gender empowerment in long-term care. And there are still some limitations in&#xD;
      the gender curriculum of current in-service education. This research will cooperate with the&#xD;
      digital learning promotion plan to stimulate learners' senses to strengthen their feelings&#xD;
      about gender equality issues and events to have a more flexible and diverse learning&#xD;
      experience and enhance geriatric care competencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This study is a two-year plan, and the purpose of each year are as follows: 1). To&#xD;
      conduct learning needs assessment of long-term care workers, and to develop and construct an&#xD;
      educational training module for gender empowerment system of AR interactive experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2). To verify the effectiveness of the gender equality knowledge, attitude, awareness, and&#xD;
      self-confidence of the research subjects after the &quot;Apply of augmented reality technology&quot;&#xD;
      was introduced into the gender curriculum.&#xD;

      Background: In the interventional study of gender mainstreaming, few studies have been&#xD;

      the gender curriculum of current in-service education. This research will cooperate with the&#xD;
      digital learning promotion plan to stimulate learners' senses to strengthen their feelings&#xD;
      about gender equality issues and events to have a more flexible and diverse learning&#xD;
      experience and enhance geriatric care competencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This study is a two-year plan, and the purpose of each year are as follows: 1). To&#xD;
      conduct learning needs assessment of long-term care workers, and to develop and construct an&#xD;
      educational training module for gender empowerment system of AR interactive experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2). To verify the effectiveness of the gender equality knowledge, attitude, awareness, and&#xD;
      self-confidence of the research subjects after the &quot;Apply of augmented reality technology&quot;&#xD;
      was introduced into the gender curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study will adopt a mixed research approach. We'll conduct focus group&#xD;
      interviews in the first year. The interviewers want to invite specialists in the fields of&#xD;
      long-term care/geriatric nursing education, scholars from the gender talent pool of the&#xD;
      Ministry of Education, and specialists in the engineering of digital smart systems.&#xD;
      Additionally, it is intended to include senior front-line long-term care providers in the&#xD;
      planning and creation of lesson plans for this platform system. A randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      (RCT) will be adopted which uses a 2-armed, controlled experiment, parallel-group design, and&#xD;
      multi-center in the second year. The setting and participants will be recruited from four&#xD;
      long-term care institution in Taipei and New Taipei city. Through the cluster random sampling&#xD;
      method, two institutions will be randomly selected from the computer based on the &quot;&#xD;
      institution &quot; from each long-term care institution, and then the allocation concealment&#xD;
      mechanism will be based on the inclusion criteria to recruit research participants, then&#xD;
      according to their willingness to participate in this project. The intervention will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups, namely treatment group (AR intervention group) and control group&#xD;
      (waiting list control group). The experimental group's intervention consists of a course that&#xD;
      embraces AR's platform for gender empowerment. The intervention course will require 50-60&#xD;
      minutes for preliminary planning, and participants in the experimental group can design at&#xD;
      least three course modules to suit their learning needs. The control group will adopt the&#xD;
      classroom narration method. The following are the primary outcome indicators: gender equality&#xD;
      knowledge scale, gender equality attitude and awareness scale, self-confidence visual analog&#xD;
      scale, learning effectiveness and System Usability Scale (SUS). The researcher uses&#xD;
      structured questionnaires to collect data before intervention (To) and after intervention&#xD;
      (T1), 1 month (T2) after the intervention. Data will be analyzed using the Generalized&#xD;
      Estimating Equation to analyze the repeated measurements and intention-to-treat analysis for&#xD;
      reducing attrition bias.&#xD;
