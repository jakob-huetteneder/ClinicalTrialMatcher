      The aim of this study is to determine patient opinions and experiences about threshold&#xD;
      electrical stimulation treatment applied to stroke patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An exploratory-descriptive qualitative study will be conducted . This study will be conducted&#xD;
      with 10 stroke patients receiving threshold electrical stimulation therapy. Threshold&#xD;
      electrical stimulation will be applied for 4 weeks, 3 days a week, for one hour. At the end&#xD;
      of the 4th week, semi-structured focus group interviews will be held with the patients. . In&#xD;
      the semi-structured focus group interviews, the same questions will be asked to all&#xD;
      participants and the verbal answers to these questions will be recorded with voice recorders.&#xD;
      Compared to taking notes by hand; It will be preferable to record the conversation with a&#xD;
      voice recorder because it has advantages such as recording all the interviews and allowing&#xD;
      the interviewer to focus on the interview. Thematic analysis method will be used in the&#xD;
      evaluation of the data.&#xD;

    <description>Threshold stimulation (EDS) is based on low-intensity (&lt;100 Hz) and long-duration current and is applied with superficial electrodes. Threshold stimulation provides a natural proprioception by depolarizing the sensory and motor nerves without causing any muscle contraction.This treatment will be applied for 4 weeks, 3 days a week, for 1 hour.</description>
