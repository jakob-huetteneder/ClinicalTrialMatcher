  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether short-course radiation therapy (1 week&#xD;
      instead of the usual 5 weeks) with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) is practical&#xD;
      (feasible), meaning that most participants are able to complete the treatment schedule.&#xD;
