  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center Phase I clinical trial of FT538 administered intravenously (IV) once&#xD;
      every 14 days for 4 consecutive doses for the reduction of the HIV reservoir in lymphoid&#xD;
      tissue of HIV-infected individuals receiving standard of care (SOC) antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (ART). As this is an early 1st in human study and the 1st for HIV-infected individual, the&#xD;
      safety of FT538 is confirmed prior to the addition of oral vorinostat to explore the concept&#xD;
      of &quot;Kick and Kill&quot;.&#xD;

    <description>FT538 is an investigational off-the-shelf cryopreserved NK cell product derived from an iPSC that contains three functional modifications: 1) a novel high affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (Fc receptor) that maintains CD16 on the cell surface and remains fully functional after NK cell activation, thus augmenting ADCC; 2) an IL-15 receptor fusion that promotes NK cell activity and enhances cell persistence; and 3) the knock-out of CD38 expression prevent anti-CD38 antibody-induced fratricide.</description>
