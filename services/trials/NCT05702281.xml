  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insertion under vision such as hysteroscopy allows the ability to visualize the uterus prior&#xD;
      to insertion, to assess uterine compatibility and the assurance of proper device placement.&#xD;
      ReLARC® is a GyneFix® device intended to be inserted via hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopic&#xD;
      insertion of the device allows direct visualization of the procedure, which makes it&#xD;
      extremely safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicentre, open-label study will take place in the Women's Clinic of the Ghent&#xD;
      University Hospital in Belgium (International Coordinating Centre) and in the University&#xD;
      Hospital AOU Federico II of Naples in Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety of the ReLARC® inserter during the insertion procedure of GyneFix®&#xD;
      intrauterine copper bearing contraceptive devices by means of successful placement with&#xD;
      adequate position during follow-up evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing no complications develop, participants will remain in the study for 3 years. 120&#xD;
      women will be enrolled.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety of the ReLARC® inserter during the insertion procedure of GyneFix®&#xD;
      intrauterine copper bearing contraceptive devices by means of successful placement with&#xD;
      adequate position during follow-up evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing no complications develop, participants will remain in the study for 3 years. 120&#xD;
      women will be enrolled. During the screeningsvisit the physician will introduce the trial.&#xD;
      During the enrolment visit, the patient will sign the informed consent if she agrees to&#xD;
      participate. During the insertion visit, the IUD will be placed, the correct location of the&#xD;
      device will be determined, the ease of ReLARC insertion and hysteroscope insertion will be&#xD;
      measured, the learning curve of the insertion will be registered and the pain score of the&#xD;
      patient will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4-8 weeks the first follow-up visit will take place. The location of the device will be&#xD;
      determined and a satisfactory score of the patient about the IUD. During 3 years there's a&#xD;
      yearly consultation with the gynaecologist where the location of the device and the&#xD;
      satisfactory score about the IUD will be determined.&#xD;

Insertion was time consuming, difficult, and dangerous.&#xD;
Insertion was not possible due to technical issues or medical reasons.</description>
