    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the safety,tolerability and preliminary efficacy of QLF32101&#xD;
      administered intravenously and subcutaneously in patients with R/R, AML.&#xD;

      This open label, first-in-human study consists of 2 parts. Part 1 consists of dose escalation&#xD;
      cohorts and Part 2 is expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include adult AML patients with relapse or refractory disease. In&#xD;
      addition, in Part 2 medium and high-risk MDS patients are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, dose escalations cohorts are followed until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or a&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or RecommendedPart2Dose (RP2D) is defined. Dose escalation&#xD;
      decisions will be made by the Data Review Committee and will be primarily guided by safety&#xD;
      data observed through the end of Cycle 1, as well as on-going assessment of safety beyond&#xD;
      Cycle 1 in later cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will begin once the MTD or RP2D is determined in Part 1. Part 2 will further&#xD;
      characterize the safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetic (PK), Pharmacodynamic (PD),&#xD;
      immunogenicity and to assess preliminary efficacy of QLF32101.&#xD;
