  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was needed to relieve the pain associated with subcutaneous injection, which is an&#xD;
      application performed by nurses, to increase patient satisfaction, to increase patient&#xD;
      compliance with treatment, and to strengthen positive patient-nurse communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of vibration stimulation application on&#xD;
      subcutan injection induced pain and patient satisfaction. The study will be carried out in&#xD;
      the internal medicine service of a university hospital. Vibration will be applied during&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection of anticoagulant to one group, but not to the other group. It was&#xD;
      planned to include 85 patients in the study.&#xD;

      This study was needed to relieve the pain associated with subcutaneous injection, which is an&#xD;
      application performed by nurses, to increase patient satisfaction, to increase patient&#xD;
      compliance with treatment, and to strengthen positive patient-nurse communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of vibration stimulation application on&#xD;
      subcutan injection induced pain and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted between September 2022 and January 2023 in the internal medicine&#xD;
      ward of a university hospital in Istanbul/Turkey in a prospective, randomized, single-blind,&#xD;
      crossover design.Two groups will be formed according to the crossover order. Volunteers will&#xD;
      be informed about the study and their written consent will be obtained. Patient evaluation&#xD;
      form, visual pain form and satisfaction scale will be applied to all patients before&#xD;
      injection. The height, weight and body mass index of the patients will be measured by the&#xD;
      specialist nurse. An anticoagulant will be administered subcutaneously over the abdominal&#xD;
      region. The areas to be injected will be determined in the same way for each patient. Low&#xD;
      molecular weight heparin will be administered subcutaneously to the umbilical region with and&#xD;
      without vibration, with an interval of 24 hours. All patients will be injected with the same&#xD;
      investigative nurse, following the standard procedure. 5 minutes after the application, the&#xD;
      pain and satisfaction level of all patients will be evaluated using scales. Vibration&#xD;
      application will be applied by the researchers for 5 minutes before the injection&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

    <description>Scale, 10 cm long, horizontal or vertical; It consists of a line starting with &quot;No Pain&quot; and ending with &quot;Unbearable Pain&quot;. The use of VAS should be explained to the patient very well. The patient is asked to indicate the severity of the pain with a sign on this line where he deems appropriate. The distance between the onset of no pain and this point is measured in cm and recorded. Values range from 0 to 10, and patients' pain levels are evaluated over 10 points as 0 = no pain, 10 = unbearable pain.</description>

    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The visual patient satisfaction scale combines with the features of the well-known VAS (Visual Analogue Scale). It consists of a 100 mm horizontal line without numbers. At one end of the line is the phrase &quot;I am not satisfied at all&quot; and at the other end is the statement &quot;Very satisfied&quot;. The patient must synthesize all the components that affect him in relation to the medical care given, determine the state of satisfaction he is in and find the point on the line that corresponds to his situation.</description>

    <description>The device used for vibration application is produced to control pain and direct attention by providing 6000/min vibration. According to Melzack and Wall's Gate Control Theory, the application of local vibration reduces perceived pain by stimulating nerve fibers. Therefore, it should be ensured that the device is in full contact with the skin. The device can be used again by wiping with 70% alcohol. The device is placed 3 cm above the area to be injected. Vibration is applied to the area for 5 minutes before the procedure.</description>
