      This is a no-profit, multicenter, biological, non-pharmacologic study aimed to characterize&#xD;
      from a biological point of view previously untreated primary ITP patients. To this end,&#xD;
      peripheral blood, fecal and bone marrow samples will be collected at baseline and at 30 days&#xD;
      and 180 days after treatment initiation - for each line of therapy - and the results of the&#xD;
      biological analysis performed at each time point will then be compared.&#xD;

      This is a no-profit, multicenter, biological, non-pharmacologic study aimed to characterize&#xD;
      from a biological point of view ITP patients. Patients with previously untreated primary ITP&#xD;
      who need first-line therapy will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, peripheral blood, fecal and bone marrow samples will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      and at 30 days and 180 days after treatment initiation. The same assessments will be repeated&#xD;
      in case of any potential new line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the biological analysis performed at each time point will then be compared, in&#xD;
      order to seek changes related to the natural history of the disease, the therapy administered&#xD;
      and the response achieved.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with primary ITP, in need for first line treatment according to 2019 ITP&#xD;
             consensus2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previously untreated patients. Patients who have already started first-line therapy&#xD;
             because of life-threatening bleeding are admitted to the study if samples are&#xD;
             collected within 24 hours of starting treatment. In such cases, as first-line&#xD;
             treatment steroids and platelet transfusions would be preferable over high-dose IVIg.&#xD;
             Treatment received before the collection of samples will be carefully documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age â‰¥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Signed written informed consent according to ICH/EU/GCP and national local laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Secondary ITP. Patients with ANA positivity without a diagnosis of SLE are admitted to&#xD;
        the study. As far as patients with ITP and antiphospholipid antibodies positivity, those&#xD;
        with triple positivity (anti-beta2glicoprotein antibodies, anti-cardiolipin antibodies,&#xD;
        lupus anticoagulans positivity) are excluded.&#xD;
