  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls during walking are common in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Fall risk can be&#xD;
      attributed in part to the loss of automaticity in walking and an increased reliance on&#xD;
      sensory cues, such as the input from the balance organ. In this project the investigators&#xD;
      want to assess the effectiveness of rehabilitation training aiming to improve this vestibular&#xD;
      input. The effects of a visual perturbation training in a virtual reality environment will be&#xD;
      compared to conventional treadmill training.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty participants (50-65 years) with idiopathic PD (Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale 2-3) will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention group receiving four weeks of VPT in a VR environment using the&#xD;
      Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive Lab system (GRAIL) or a control group receiving four&#xD;
      weeks of regular treadmill training. Primary outcome measures are spatio-temporal outcome&#xD;
      parameters of gait and dynamic stability (gait speed, stride time/length, cadence,&#xD;
      step-to-step variability, step width variability and trunk sway), and self-reported falls,&#xD;
      and will be recorded at all testing phases (pre-test, after baseline, after intervention and&#xD;
      after detraining). Secondary outcome measures will include assessments of central and&#xD;
      peripheral vestibular function (Cervical and ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials)&#xD;
      for correlation with the primary outcome measures. The secondary outcomes will be recorded at&#xD;
      pre-testing and directly after the intervention phase.&#xD;
