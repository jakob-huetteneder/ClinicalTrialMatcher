      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple crossover strategy would be non-inferior to SB opening strategy in the risk of target&#xD;
      lesion failure (TLF) in patients with angiographically compromised SB (visually SB stenosis&#xD;
      ≥50%) after provisional MV stenting for non-left main bifurcation lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1000 patients (500 per each group) with the angiographically compromised SB&#xD;
      (visually SB stenosis ≥50%) after provisional MV stenting for non-left main bifurcation&#xD;
      lesion will be enrolled. Patients will be randomized to either the simple crossover strategy&#xD;
      group or SB opening strategy group at the time of enrollment with 1:1 ratio. Stratified&#xD;
      randomization according to participating center, clinical presentation (acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome or stable ischemic heart disease), and type of bifurcation lesions (true or&#xD;
      non-true) will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in stenting techniques and devices, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)&#xD;
      for bifurcation lesions remains one of the most challenging and complex procedures. Current&#xD;
      guidelines recommend 1-stenting with provisional side branch (SB) approach should be an&#xD;
      initial treatment strategy for the bifurcation lesions, based on the previous results of&#xD;
      several randomized trials. However, the standardization of the provisional strategy is&#xD;
      limited. In particular, there is a recommendation on the treatment technique for SB when SB&#xD;
      intervention is required, but It has not been decided in which cases SB treatment is&#xD;
      necessary, in the latest European Bifurcation Club (EBC) consensus document.16 In previous&#xD;
      studies, the criteria for performing SB opening after MV stent intervention in the 1-stenting&#xD;
      with provisional SB approach were varied. In the DK-CUSH II (Double Kissing Crush versus&#xD;
      Provisional Stenting Technique for Treatment of Coronary Bifurcation Lesions) or CACTUS&#xD;
      (Coronary Bifurcations: Application of the Crushing Technique Using Sirolimus-Eluting Stents)&#xD;
      trials, SB intervention was performed when the SB diameter stenosis more than 50%, grade B or&#xD;
      higher dissection, or blood flow disturbance (TIMI flow 2 or less) after MV stent insertion.&#xD;
      On the other hand, in the Nordic trial, the authors applied strict criteria for SB&#xD;
      intervention after MV stent insertion (TIMI flow 2 or less only). Furthermore, there have&#xD;
      been conflicting results regarding the clinical and angiographic outcomes of the jailed SB&#xD;
      opening strategy after the main vessel (MV) stenting, compared with the simple crossover&#xD;
      strategy for non-left main bifurcation lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this background, this trial aims to compare the clinical outcomes between simple crossover&#xD;
      and side branch opening strategies in patients with the angiographically compromised SB&#xD;
      (visually SB stenosis ≥50%) after provisional MV stenting for non-left main bifurcation&#xD;
      lesion.&#xD;

    <description>Regardless of allocated arms, stent implantation in the MV (selected 1:1 according to the distal MV size) followed by systematic proximal optimization technique (POT, post-dilatation of the stent at the level of proximal MV with a balloon diameter sized 1:1 according to the proximal MV) or POT like procedure is strongly recommended.</description>

    <description>According to the latest European Bifurcation Club (EBC) consensus document, distal SB rewiring followed by kissing balloon inflation (eventually conducted with short non-compliant balloons) and repeat POT procedures are highly recommended. An additional stent will be allowed if major dissection or decreased TIMI flow of SB occurs during SB treatment.</description>
