    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a uterine sound sparing&#xD;
      technique for levonorgestrel 52 mg intrauterine device (IUD) placement. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted in three phases. In phase one, the IUD will be placed in standard fashion with a&#xD;
      uterine sound to obtain baseline data. Phase two and three are interventional phases that&#xD;
      will investigate IUD placement without the use of a uterine sound. In phase two, the IUD will&#xD;
      be placed without the use of a uterine sound, but under abdominal ultrasound guidance. In&#xD;
      phase three, the IUD will be placed without the use of a uterine sound and without ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance. An ultrasound exam will be completed at the end of phase two and three to determine&#xD;
      if the IUD was successful placed. To answer the secondary objectives, for all study phases&#xD;
      the investigators will measure the procedure time, the participant-reported maximum pain&#xD;
      during and 5-minutes post placement and the provider assessment of ease of placement. To&#xD;
      determine the exploratory objective of IUD expulsion and perforation rate for a uterine sound&#xD;
      sparing IUD placement technique, participants in phases two and three will complete a 30-day&#xD;
      phone follow up and 90-day in clinic follow up to evaluate for IUD expulsion or perforation.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the levonorgestrel 52 mg IUD can successfully be inserted&#xD;
      without uterine sounding.&#xD;

    <measure>Participant-reported maximum pain during IUD placement measured with a 100-mm visual analog scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured once on day of IUD placement</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be handed a 100-mm visual analog scale and asked to mark their pain level. The assessment will be performed immediately following removal of IUD inserter and before the IUD thread is cut. Outcomes will be compared for each of the three phases.</description>

    <measure>Participant-reported pain 5-minutes post IUD placement, meaured with a 100-mm visual analog scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured once on day of IUD placement</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be handed a 100-mm visual analog scale and asked to mark their pain level. The assessment will be performed five minutes following removal of the speculum at the end of IUD placement procedure. Outcomes will be compared for each of the three phases.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Provider assessment of ease of placement defined as an easy, moderate or difficult placement.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured once on day of IUD placement</time_frame>
    <description>Providers placing the IUD will be asked to rate their assessment of the the ease of the IUD placement procedure as easy, moderate or difficult after completing IUD placement procedure. Outcomes will be compared for each of the three phases.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>IUD expulsion and perforation rate during first three months after placement with sound-sparing technique</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at time of IUD insertion and three month clinic follow up three months after IUD placement</time_frame>
    <description>An ultrasound exam will be completed on the day of the IUD placement to determine if the IUD is present in the uterine cavity and not perforated outside of the uterine cavity or expelled out of the uterine cavity. Outcomes will be reported for participants in phases two and three.</description>
