      Generally, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) are&#xD;
      the methods of choice for the removal of benign and early malignant neoplasms of the colon.&#xD;
      However, there are certain difficulties in terms of the EMR technique - this is an increase&#xD;
      in the frequency of fragmentation with a lesion size of more than 20 mm, which in turn&#xD;
      increases the risk of recurrence; with regard to ESD technique, this is a long procedure&#xD;
      time; high incidence of complications; significant time required for teaching the technique;&#xD;
      technical difficulties. In this regard, it is worth paying attention to the method of&#xD;
      &quot;endoscopic mucosal resection with circumferential mucosal incision&quot; (C-EMR). This method&#xD;
      deserves interest due to the fact that it allows more often to perform en-block resections in&#xD;
      comparison with the classical method of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR - endoscopic&#xD;
      mucosal resection); technically easier to do; takes a short procedure time.&#xD;

    <description>The endoscope will be passed into the intestine to the site of the tumor. Then, using an endoscopic needle, a solution will be injected into the submucosa to remove the neoplasm. Using an endoscopic knife (insulated tip knife, Olympus or Water Jet, Erbe), a circular incision will be made around the lesion. Then there will be a one-stage electro excision of the neoplasm using an endoscopic loop.</description>

Then, using an endoscopic knife (insulated tip knife, Olympus or Water Jet, Erbe), a circular incision will be made around the lesion with an offset of 2-5 mm. Then there will be a one-stage electro excision of the neoplasm using an endoscopic loop.</description>
