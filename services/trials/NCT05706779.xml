  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot trial which aims to assess the concept of anti-BRAF neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
      (encorafenib) in combination with cetuximab in patients with colon cancer or rT3/T4&#xD;
      supra-peritoneal upper rectal cancer based on a pre-operative CT-scan. About 10% of patients&#xD;
      will have a mutated BRAF V600E tumour and the objective is to include 30 patients with this&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the tumour is not confirmed as a carrier of the BRAF V600E mutation or has an RAS mutation&#xD;
      according to centralised assessment, treatment will be discontinued in this patient and&#xD;
      cancer surgery will be organised as soon as possible. The patient will be excluded from the&#xD;
      statistical analysis and will be replaced by a new patient in order to obtain 30 patients&#xD;
      with confirmed BRAF V600E mutation and RAS wild type . It should be noted that less than a 3%&#xD;
      discrepancy between the numbers of local laboratory results and central analysis results, has&#xD;
      been reported in over 600 BRAF V600E mutated colon cancers in the BEACON CRC study. Based on&#xD;
      these figures, there should be 0 or 1 patient with discrepant results in the study presented&#xD;
      here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, in the hypothetical case of a patient who is an early permanent discontinuation&#xD;
      of the study prior to surgery, this patient will be replaced in order to obtain a total of 30&#xD;
      patients who underwent surgery after neoadjuvant treatment.&#xD;
