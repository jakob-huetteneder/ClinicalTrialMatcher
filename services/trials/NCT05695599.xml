  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morbid obesity is defined as a complex chronic condition in which a person presents a body&#xD;
      mass index above 40 kg/m2. This disease increases the risk of several co-morbidities and&#xD;
      entails a reduction in life expectancy of 10 years. Its prevalence is increasing in developed&#xD;
      countries and bariatric surgery has been suggested to be one of the best tools to counteract&#xD;
      it. Nonetheless, this surgery also presents negative effects such as loss of bone mineral&#xD;
      density (BMD) and muscle mass and an increased fracture risk. The aim of the present study is&#xD;
      to elucidate the effects of surgery and a whole body vibration training (WBV) on body&#xD;
      composition, physical fitness, microbiota and cardiometabolic markers. Twenty eight&#xD;
      participants will undergo bariatric surgery and will be randomly allocated into a control&#xD;
      group or a WBV group. The whole body vibration group will have a duration of 4 months in&#xD;
      which participants will train three times per week (30 minutes per session). Measurements of&#xD;
      body composition (dual energy x-ray and peripheral quantitative computed tomography),&#xD;
      physical fitness (muscular strength, aerobic fitness and balance), gait biomechanics,&#xD;
      cardiometabolic markers, gut microbiota, quality of life and physical activity levels will be&#xD;
      registered in four different timepoints (1. Before the intervention, 2) 45 days after the&#xD;
      surgery, 3) Six months after the surgery, and 4) 18 months after the surgery. The cost of the&#xD;
      surgery and the exercise program will also be calculated to perform a cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
