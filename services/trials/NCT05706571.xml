      Introduction Description of the Subject/ Problem Status The end-of-life period is the period&#xD;
      in which health declines due to the last stage of the disease, the organism loses its ability&#xD;
      to renew itself, and the state of being alive ends. This process affects both the family and&#xD;
      the patient in many ways. Meeting the physical, spiritual, psychological, and cultural needs&#xD;
      of the family and the patient in the last days and hours of life reflects the nurse's&#xD;
      holistic care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step towards becoming a skilled clinician and advocacy guide for the nurse who&#xD;
      cares for the sick individual in the last days and hours of life is to have a clear&#xD;
      understanding of what care the patient and family want at the end of life . The basic desires&#xD;
      of patients and families at the end of life. It is process-oriented and relationship-based&#xD;
      rather than focusing on medical goals. In addition, patients prefer to die at home (Tang,&#xD;
      2003), symptom management and communication management of a specialist healthcare&#xD;
      professional in reporting bad news are among the important themes of end-of-life care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide evidence-based care in nursing education, expert educators use patients created&#xD;
      with simulation-based virtual reality methods, high-quality human simulators, standardized&#xD;
      patients, augmented reality, and virtually created patients . Virtual reality can&#xD;
      artificially recreate all senses, and experiences, including sight, hearing, touch, and&#xD;
      smell. Augmented reality tries to replace reality by bridging &quot;virtual and real worlds&quot; (Wu&#xD;
      H-K, Lee SW-Y, Chang H-Y, Liang J-C. 2013; Ferguson, C., Davidson, P. M., Scott, P. J.,&#xD;
      Jackson, D., &amp;Hickman, L. D. (2015) These methods help students provide appropriate nursing&#xD;
      care safely and efficiently without fear of their professional skills and knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of simulation in nursing education is an integral part of the curriculum and will&#xD;
      demonstrate the benefit of learning to nurse students of all levels. The next phase of&#xD;
      simulation-based learning is the wide variety of new technologies currently available,&#xD;
      including virtual and augmented reality. The use of these new technologies will bring the&#xD;
      need for standard definitions, assessment of the impact on learning, and new opportunities&#xD;
      for research. By incorporating virtual and augmented reality into the curricula of nurse&#xD;
      academicians, simulation-based learning methods will provide an opportunity to create a new&#xD;
      era in education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While providing care for the individual in the last days and hours of life, it is very&#xD;
      difficult for nurses to control the individual's own feelings about the death process when&#xD;
      the individual suffers, and works with families in an extremely difficult time . Nurses'&#xD;
      training on pediatric end-of-life care includes a wide variety of modules, including didactic&#xD;
      sessions, supervised clinical practice, mentoring, role-playing of predetermined scenarios,&#xD;
      simulated/standardized patient encounters, computer-based gaming, augmented reality (AR), and&#xD;
      virtual reality (VR) modules. teaching methods are used . Academics and nurses have to adjust&#xD;
      the experiences they learn in many different ways to suit the student. Augmented reality&#xD;
      (AR), virtual reality (SG), and play all provide an immersive student experience where new&#xD;
      ways of learning are needed more than ever before. will be used in many settings to optimize&#xD;
      care and improve the health outcomes of individuals in all care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A theoretical foundation will be needed if the simulation is to continue to progress as a&#xD;
      discipline. Benner's &quot;Novice to Expert Model&quot; will provide the necessary conceptual structure&#xD;
      to guide simulation facilitator development and aid understanding of the learning path.&#xD;
      Although individuals who use the simulation are experts in their clinical fields, they go&#xD;
      back to the novice stage when they start to practice. This model-based approach, which&#xD;
      defines and implements the developmental stage of nurses (Novice, Competence, Competence,&#xD;
      Mastery, and Expertise), will serve as a guide for simulation education-training programs and&#xD;
      infrastructure Purpose of the study This study will be carried out to determine the effect of&#xD;
      teaching with augmented reality and the Benner model on the learning of the pediatric&#xD;
      end-of-life care module of nursing students.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Importance of the Study The complex nature of pediatric end-of-life care requires extensive&#xD;
      training for nurses working with children and their families in life-threatening conditions.&#xD;
      Knowledge of evidence-based best practices is an essential component of this training.&#xD;
      However, due to the nature of working with a vulnerable population, additional educational&#xD;
      elements will be required for quality care .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation-based learning on virtual patients is a widely accepted teaching method in nursing&#xD;
      education. It bridges theory and practice and provides the opportunity for novice nursing&#xD;
      students to practice the skills necessary for practice in a safe environment. Novice students&#xD;
      do not have the experience or context to form the clear mental picture or image required for&#xD;
      simulated scenarios. (Vaughn, J., Lister, M., &amp; Shaw, RJ (2016). Mobile applications such as&#xD;
      AG/SG in simulated patients will give novice clinicians a chance to subvert a group of&#xD;
      virtual patients before taking on a live patient.This study will provide novice nurses with a&#xD;
      roadmap on how to approach patients with AR application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the evidence-based practices in nursing education, another education will provide&#xD;
      theory and model-based care to the individual. Benner's &quot;Novice to Expert Model&quot; provides the&#xD;
      necessary conceptual structure to guide the facilitator's development of simulation and aid&#xD;
      understanding of the learning path. In Benner's model, experience, education, and clinical&#xD;
      knowledge development were discussed in determining the competency levels of nurses.&#xD;
      End-of-life care modules provide holistic care for the needs of the child and family. These&#xD;
      modules include evidence-based practice, family-centered care, The cultural values of the&#xD;
      patient and family, the grieving process, symptom management, and communication methods in&#xD;
      reporting bad news will be a guide in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many educational technologies that change the social structure in the twenty-first century&#xD;
      are constantly being renewed and developed. As new educational technologies develop,&#xD;
      different learning methods from classical learning methods develop. One of these methods is&#xD;
      the augmented reality method. Augmented reality application provides theoretical and&#xD;
      practical training as a whole in nursing education to prepare the student for professional&#xD;
      life in end-of-life care and to give the student a professional nursing identity. In this&#xD;
      study; With the augmented reality application, it is expected that the student's affective,&#xD;
      cognitive and psychomotor skills will be improved. Students will be able to use these skills&#xD;
      wherever they want with the application installed on their mobile phones without entering the&#xD;
      laboratory environment. Depending on the learning in end-of-life care based on the Benner&#xD;
      model with augmented reality method, the student; when he/she starts clinical practice,&#xD;
      he/she will be provided to develop clinical wisdom and clinical decision-making skills. In&#xD;
      addition, the augmented reality application, increases the professional skill performance /&#xD;
      academic success level of the students, directing the student to learn by experimenting with&#xD;
      three-dimensional audio / visual animations, quick decision-making in a complicated&#xD;
      end-of-life situation, and a realistic educational environment. it is aimed to increase the&#xD;
      skill competence to the level of &quot;expertise at the novice level&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;

      in which quantitative and qualitative approaches are included in order to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of teaching with augmented reality and the Benner model on the learning of the&#xD;
      pediatric end-of-life care module of nursing students.&#xD;
