  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the efficacy of CORE™ devices in calculating core body&#xD;
      temperature in athletes under varying environmental conditions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As athletes exercise, their core body temperature rises, which can affect their performance.&#xD;
      Additionally, repeated mild to moderate heat stress, heat acclimation, can be used to improve&#xD;
      exercise tolerance and performance. Thus, an athlete can gain performance benefits through&#xD;
      monitoring their heat loading while training. The aim of this study is to compare the CORE™&#xD;
      body temperatures recorded during exercise in two different environmental conditions in which&#xD;
      the investigators will get a separation of core temperature and skin temperature. The&#xD;
      investigators will accomplish this by recruiting trained and elite athletes, ages 18-59, to&#xD;
      participate in two exercise sessions in the heat at low (10-20%) and high (80-100%) relative&#xD;
      humidity. The investigators will compare the CORE™ temperature estimates against an FDA&#xD;
      approved ingestible temperature monitoring device to assess the accuracy of the CORE™&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;

Experimental sessions will occur at least seven days apart and participants will be randomly assigned to which condition they experience first.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The CORE and CaleraResearch devices estimate core body temperature using single-site skin temperature and heartrate as data inputs for their proprietary algorithm. This calculated temperature will be assessed against actual core body temperature, measured with an FDA approved, ingestible, temperature-sensing telemetry pill.</description>

    <description>This study is to verify the claims of CORE™ body temperature system to estimate core body temperature from skin temperature and heart rate during exercise under varying environmental conditions. Subjects will ingest a temperature sensing pill and be outfitted with skin temperature sensors, a chest strap heart rate monitor, and the CORE and CaleraResearch devices. Athletes will run or cycle in hot/dry and hot/humid conditions for 45 minutes at an absolute workload of 60% VO2 Max/Peak.</description>
