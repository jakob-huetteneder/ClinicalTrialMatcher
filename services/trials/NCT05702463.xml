    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study will include patients suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus and will&#xD;
      first study their response to enteric coated aspirin at a dose of 80 mg per day for a 7-day&#xD;
      period. Participants with an incomplete platelet inhibition after exposure to EC aspirin at&#xD;
      doses of 80 mg once daily will be randomized to a random order of 3 different ASA regimens:&#xD;
      EC ASA 162 mg once daily, EC ASA 81 mg twice daily and chewable ASA 40 mg twice daily. The&#xD;
      aims are to determine the feasibility of a larger scale trial, and to determine the regimen&#xD;
      associated with the lowest proportion of non-responders after randomization. Platelet&#xD;
      function will be assessed at baseline and at day 7 of each arms of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      APPEASED II is a triple crossover, open-label, randomized controlled pilot trial preceded by&#xD;
      a 7-day run in period, aiming to determine the feasibility of a larger confirmatory&#xD;
      randomized trial, and to determine the regimen associated with the lowest proportion of&#xD;
      non-responders after randomization of EC ASA 162 mg once daily, EC ASA 81 mg twice daily and&#xD;
      chewable ASA 40 mg twice daily in patients with type 2 diabetes.The primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      to determine, among initial ASA non-responder participants in the run-in phase, the&#xD;
      proportion of participants that remain ASA non-responders with different formulations and&#xD;
      dosing regimens of ASA, including EC ASA 162 mg once daily, EC ASA 81 mg twice daily and&#xD;
      chewable ASA 40 mg twice daily. The incomplete platelet aggregation will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      response to arachidonic acid at a concentration of 1mM, measured by LTA (Light Transmission&#xD;
      Aggregometry). For every platelet function assessment, serum salicylate concentration will&#xD;
      also be measured. Upon the screening visit (day 0), blood will be drawn and baseline platelet&#xD;
      function will be assessed. A 7 day supply of aspirin will be given to participants meeting&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria. Participants will be instructed to take 1 dose of 80 mg of enteric&#xD;
      coated aspirin per day at the same time every day. Upon day 7, participants will return for a&#xD;
      second visit before the intake of their daily aspirin, and therefore 24 hours after the&#xD;
      previous dose of aspirin was taken. Blood will be drawn and platelet function will be&#xD;
      assessed in the same manner as described previously. Participants will then take their 7th&#xD;
      dose of aspirin under supervision, and a blood sample will be collected and platelet function&#xD;
      will be assessed two hours later. If participants have an incomplete platelet inhibition&#xD;
      after exposure to EC aspirin at doses of 80 mg once daily, they will be randomized to a&#xD;
      random order of 3 different ASA regimens: EC ASA 162 mg once daily, EC ASA 81 mg twice daily&#xD;
      and chewable ASA 40 mg twice daily. These participants will receive the pillbox containing&#xD;
      the first assigned regimen on this visit. The 3 study arms and the run-in phase will last 7&#xD;
      days each, with at least 7 days of wash-out between each arm. To accommodate participants&#xD;
      with busy schedules and to minimize follow-up losses, a longer washout period will be&#xD;
      tolerated if the participant is unable to return to the research center after 14 days. At&#xD;
      every visit of the randomized portion of the trial, participants will leave with the next&#xD;
      6-day ASA regimen in a pillbox, that is 6 doses for the once daily regimen and 13 doses for&#xD;
      the twice daily regimens. On day 7 of all three study arms, patients will be questioned about&#xD;
      medication adherence with the presence of the participant's pillbox. Two blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected, one 24 hours after the last dose and one 2 hours after taking the last dose in&#xD;
      front of the investigators. The platelet aggregation inhibition with arachidonic acid and&#xD;
      platelet reactivity to various agonists will be assessed by LTA. Serum levels of TxB2 will&#xD;
      also be assessed.&#xD;
