  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African American adults sleep less and obtain worse quality sleep compared to the national&#xD;
      average, and emerging evidence links inadequate sleep with greater morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      from chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and cancer. To address this public health&#xD;
      concern, the proposed research seeks to use a multi-method approach to adapt a sleep&#xD;
      intervention for African American adults with overweight/obesity not meeting national sleep&#xD;
      duration or physical activity recommendations. The overall goal of the project is to reduce&#xD;
      cancer and obesity-related health disparities among African Americans.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study uses qualitative interviews (Aim 1; n=10) to inform the adaptation of a sleep intervention for African American adults with overweight/obesity, short sleep, and physical inactivity. The feasibility, satisfaction, and preliminary efficacy will be tested (Aim 2) using a 2-armed randomized control trial (n=80).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The sleep extension intervention is a 4-week intervention consisting of weekly one-on-one contact with the goal of increasing total sleep time by 60 minutes by the end of four weeks conducted by Dr. Wu or a trained counselor. The first session will last 60 minutes and the content will include psychoeducation about the importance of sleep, sleep guidelines and target setting, and basic sleep hygiene. Participants in this condition will receive hardcopy weekly daily diary worksheets, and receive an online version of the sleep daily diary every morning to complete via text messaging. Sessions 2-4 will be between 15-30 minutes where Dr. Wu or a trained counselor will review the sleep diary, problem solve barriers to weekly goals, and sleep promoting behaviors will be reinforced. Material that would be covered during a missed session will be included in the next session the participant attends.</description>

    <description>The content of the contacts for this intervention condition will be based on the National Center for Healthy Housing's Healthy Homes program, a program designed by the UT School of Public Health. Participants in this condition will meet with Dr. Wu or a trained research staff member. They will meet through Zoom once a week for four sessions to go through each educational module. Sessions will conclude with the development of an action plan for participants. Staff will check in with participants regarding whether they were able to complete the tasks on their action plan, and if not, the reasons for this and potential strategies that may facilitate completion.</description>
