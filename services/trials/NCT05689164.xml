    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the safety and effects of an experimental gene&#xD;
      therapy called fordadistrogene movaparvovec. We are seeking participants from previous Pfizer&#xD;
      interventional studies. We will follow participants' experience in this study for 10 years&#xD;
      after the end of their previous study. Participants will have 1 annual onsite visit and a few&#xD;
      annual remote visits. The exact number of remote visits will be decided by their study&#xD;
      doctor.&#xD;
