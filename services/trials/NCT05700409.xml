  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to evaluate whether a novel telemedicine-based intensive treatment&#xD;
      program for children with obesity is superior to standard on-site care. This will be a&#xD;
      randomized, non-blinded (due to the nature of the intervention) study, where 100 children and&#xD;
      adolescents aged 10-18 years with obesity will be divided in a 1:1 ratio to either&#xD;
      telemedicine or on-site treatments for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The telemedicine arm will include 30, mostly video, consultations for each participant: 3&#xD;
      physician appointments, 7 exercise consultations by our exercise physiologist, 10 dietary&#xD;
      consultations by our pediatric dietitian, and 10 psychologist consultations to assist with&#xD;
      goal setting and overall well-being. Three visits will be conducted in-office, for physician&#xD;
      assessment, smartphone technical assistance and physical measurements (baseline, at 3 months&#xD;
      and at the end of the 6-month period). Participants randomized to the telemedicine arm will&#xD;
      have a step-counting rewarding app installed on their smartphone by our staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in-office arm will have 6 monthly visits during the study period, with two consultations&#xD;
      performed in each visit - one by the physician or exercise physiologist, and one by our&#xD;
      pediatric dietitian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome of the study is BMI standard deviation (z-score) changes, which will be&#xD;
      evaluated after 3 and 6 months of treatment during physical office visits in both study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body-fat percent changes, assessed by bioimpedance analysis in physical clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily step counts, measured by smartphone data/ wearable activity tracker, if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight-related quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retention and visit cancellation rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satisfaction of both parent and child from their allocated treatment.&#xD;
