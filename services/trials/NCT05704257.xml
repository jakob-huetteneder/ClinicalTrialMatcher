  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of fetal repair of&#xD;
      complex gastroschisis (GS) via a fetoscopic surgical approach by assessing maternal, fetal,&#xD;
      neonatal, and infant outcomes in a cohort of 10 patients. The hypothesis is that in utero&#xD;
      repair of GS will reduce postnatal mortality and morbidity in complex GS infants with minimal&#xD;
      maternal and fetal risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroschisis is a congenital abdominal wall defect by which the intestinal structures&#xD;
      eviscerate from the abdomen, with a current prevalence of 4.9 per 10,000 pregnancies in the&#xD;
      United States. Not only is it the most common abdominal wall defect, but the incidence of GS&#xD;
      has increased by nearly 30% in the US (Jones et al., 2016) and 25 % in Europe (EUROCAT, 2021)&#xD;
      between 2006 and 2012 for reasons that are still unknown. Two subtypes of the disease have&#xD;
      been identified - simple and complex GS. Simple GS presents as an otherwise healthy bowel&#xD;
      that may have an inflammatory peel over the bowel surface. By contrast, complex GS is&#xD;
      characterized by serious bowel complications, such as bowel volvulus, atresia, stenosis,&#xD;
      necrosis, and perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be offered the minimally invasive in-utero repair technique as an&#xD;
      alternative to the traditional standard postnatal GS surgical repair. During surgery, the&#xD;
      mother's uterus is opened using the standard laparotomy approach that we currently use in our&#xD;
      open fetal surgeries and fetoscopic spina bifida repair through an exteriorized uterus, and&#xD;
      then fetal surgeons repair the fetus' defect. The uterus is closed, and the pregnancy&#xD;
      continues. When babies are treated in this way, they may be less likely to be born with their&#xD;
      intestines coming out of their belly and if this is the case, they may be less likely to have&#xD;
      other problems that occur with gastroschisis because the intestines are not covered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be closely followed with ultrasound and consultation after the surgery.&#xD;
      Delivery will be scheduled at Texas Children's Hospital, and the infants will be followed for&#xD;
      12 months by our research team.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant women - maternal age 18 years or older and capable of consenting for her own&#xD;
             participation in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Singleton pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Sonographic evidence of gastroschisis (exteriorization of bowel content outside the&#xD;
             fetal abdominal cavity into the amniotic cavity)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Intraabdominal bowel dilation ≥ 10 mm at 20-24 weeks GA reviewed by prenatal&#xD;
             ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Absence of significant associated anomalies* diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Gestational age at the time of the procedure will be between 20 0/7 weeks and 25 6/7&#xD;
             weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Absence of chromosomal and clinically significant abnormalities, i.e., normal&#xD;
             karyotype and/or normal chromosomal microarray (CMA) by invasive testing&#xD;
             (amniocentesis or Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)). If there is a balanced&#xD;
             translocation with normal CMA with no other anomalies the candidate can be included.&#xD;
             Patients declining invasive testing will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The family has considered and declined the option of termination of the pregnancy at&#xD;
             less than 24 weeks and of standard postnatal treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The family meets psychosocial criteria (sufficient social support, ability to&#xD;
             understand the requirements of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Parental/guardian permission (informed consent) for follow up of the child after birth&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Significant associated anomalies are defined as such anomalies that would, in and&#xD;
                  of themselves, be life limiting or life threatening. A minor anomaly, such as a&#xD;
                  small VSD or ASD not deemed to be life limiting or threatening, or a cleft lip or&#xD;
                  other such anomaly, unless part of a genetic syndrome, will not disqualify the&#xD;
                  patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Significant fetal anomaly unrelated to gastroschisis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Evidence of bowel perforation (presence of intraabdominal bowel calcification on&#xD;
             ultrasonography)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Increased risk for preterm labor including short cervical length (≤ 2.0 cm), history&#xD;
             of incompetent cervix with or without cerclage, and previous preterm birth in a&#xD;
             singleton pregnancy (other than a patient delivered for a non-repeating medical or&#xD;
             surgical indication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Placental abnormalities (previa, abruption, accreta) known at time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pre-pregnancy body-mass index (BMI) ≥40&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Contraindications to surgery including previous hysterotomy (whether from a previous&#xD;
             classical cesarean, uterine anomaly such as an arcuate or bicornuate uterus, major&#xD;
             myomectomy resection, or previous fetal surgery) in active uterine segment&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Technical limitations precluding fetoscopic surgery, such as extensive uterine&#xD;
             fibroids, fetal membrane separation, or uterine anomalies&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Maternal-fetal Rh alloimmunization, Kell sensitization, or neonatal alloimmune&#xD;
             thrombocytopenia affecting the current pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Maternal HIV, Hepatitis-B, Hepatitis-C status positive because of the increased risk&#xD;
             of transmission to the fetus during maternal-fetal surgery. If the patient's HIV or&#xD;
             Hepatitis status is unknown, the patient must be tested and found to have negative&#xD;
             results before enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Maternal medical condition that is a contraindication to surgery or general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Low amniotic fluid volume (Amniotic Fluid Index less than 6 cm) if deemed to be due to&#xD;
             fetal anomaly, poor placental perfusion or function, or membrane rupture. Low amniotic&#xD;
             fluid volume that responds to maternal hydration is not an exclusion criterion&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient does not have a support person (i.e., spouse, partner, or mother) available to&#xD;
             support her for the duration of the pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Inability to comply with the travel and follow-up requirements of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patient scores as severely depressed on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale&#xD;
             (EPDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients that are enrolled or have been enrolled in any another intervention study&#xD;
             that affects the mother or fetus&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Maternal hypersensitivity to any of the entities associated w/ AlloDerm™. The use of&#xD;
             AlloDerm™ Regenerative Tissue Matrix distributed by Allergan Aesthetics is&#xD;
             contraindicated for patients sensitive to any of the antibiotics listed on the&#xD;
             AlloDerm package, i.e., Gentamycin, Cefoxitin, Lincomycin, Polymyxin B and Vancomycin&#xD;
             or Polysorbate 20&#xD;
