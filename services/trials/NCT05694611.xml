    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate levels of brain perfusion and elasticity in preterm&#xD;
      neonates when they reach the estimated due date and to compare the data with magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging at term. Contrast enhanced ultrasound (sulphur hexafluoride) and&#xD;
      ultrasound-assisted elastography will be used to evaluate the state of brain perfusion with&#xD;
      ultrasound. Different appropriate imaging sequences will be used regarding MRI, including&#xD;
      asl-perfusion. Neonates recruited from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Turku&#xD;
      University Hospital will be recruited.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      SonoVue (sulphur hexafluoride) is a contrast agent composed of micro bubbles. It increases&#xD;
      echogenicity of the ultrasound thus enhancing the visualisation of vessels and giving better&#xD;
      insights into tissue perfusion. The use of sulphur hexafluoride has been approved by FDA and&#xD;
      it has been in off-label use in Europe for years. SonoVue is thought to be especially useful&#xD;
      for children, because it can enhance the diagnostic capabilities of ultrasound and the&#xD;
      examination can be performed without radiation or sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elastography is a method to investigate the elasticity of a tissue by tracking the shear&#xD;
      waves generated by the ultrasound beam. Also this method has been used in Europe and America&#xD;
      for years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine cerebral hemodynamics in preterm neonates reaching term&#xD;
      age, using ultrasound of the brain, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      shear-wave elastography (US-SWE). The brain ultrasound, CEUS and US-SWE to preterm babies is&#xD;
      planned to take place while having a clinically appointed brain magnetic resonance imaging at&#xD;
      about term. Total recruitment for the study is 100 infants in total. The recruitment period&#xD;
      will be up to seven years if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injections of SonoVue will be administered through pre-existing venous cannulas. The&#xD;
      examination will be done in addition to the MR-imaging, after the parental consent has been&#xD;
      given. The ultrasound examination altogether is estimated to take about 20 minutes per day.&#xD;
      Safety monitoring period is conducted after the injection. CEUS data will be analysed with&#xD;
      proper software. US-SWE will be measured repeatedly on both brain hemispheres and on&#xD;
      different areas to validate the measurements. Ultrasound data will be evaluated comparing&#xD;
      preterm neonates with and without MRI-proven brain pathology and comparing the&#xD;
      ultrasound-achieved data to magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
