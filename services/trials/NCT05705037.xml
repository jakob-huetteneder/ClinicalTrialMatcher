  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the association of casein&#xD;
      phosphopeptide plus amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACPF) mousse and photo-bio-modulation&#xD;
      therapy (PMBT) (diode laser, RAFFAELLO 980 BIO - Dental Medical Technologies - DMT S.r.l.) in&#xD;
      the treatment of dental hypersensitivity (DH) in children with Molar Incisor&#xD;
      Hypomineralization (MIH) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged 6-14 years with hypersensitive teeth were randomized into 3 groups. Group A&#xD;
      received the application of CPP-ACPF mousse (GC MI Paste®) and sham light therapy; group B&#xD;
      got the application of placebo mousse (Elmex Junior®) and PMBT; group C received both&#xD;
      CPP-ACPF mousse and PMBT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Three desensitizing treatment sessions for each group (group A, group B, group C) were&#xD;
      performed with a 7 days-interval. The detailed protocol for each treatment is described&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (CPP-ACPF mousse + sham light therapy) CPP-ACPF mousse (GC MI Paste®) was applied&#xD;
      with a microbrush on the cervical buccal surface of each tooth for 5 minutes and it was&#xD;
      subsequently distributed for 20 seconds with a rubber cup coupled to a low speed handpiece.&#xD;
      Right after, a sham therapy was performed, using RAFFAELLO 980 BIO - Dental Medical&#xD;
      Technologies - DMT S.r.l. Although the device was switched on, the hand piece did not work&#xD;
      and the sound was emitted by a mobile phone. The tip of the laser device was positioned on&#xD;
      two areas for each dental element, located one in the center of the cervical region and the&#xD;
      other in the middle third of the crown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (placebo mousse + PBMT) A placebo mousse (Elmex Junior®) was applied with a&#xD;
      microbrush on the cervical buccal surface of each tooth for 5 minutes and it was subsequently&#xD;
      distributed for 20 seconds with a rubber cup coupled to a low speed handpiece. Right after, a&#xD;
      PBMT was performed, using RAFFAELLO 980 BIO - Dental Medical Technologies - DMT S.r.l. The&#xD;
      tip of the laser device was positioned on two areas for each dental element, located one in&#xD;
      the center of the cervical region and the other in the middle third of the crown. The&#xD;
      parameters used were: wavelength 980 nm, power 4 W, irradiation area1 cm2, application time&#xD;
      15 sec per 1 cm2, energy density 60 J/cm2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C (CPP-ACPF + PBMT) CPP-ACPF mousse (GC MI Paste®) was applied with a microbrush on the&#xD;
      cervical buccal surface of each tooth for 5 minutes and it was subsequently distributed for&#xD;
      20 seconds with a rubber cup coupled to a low speed handpiece. Right after, a PBMT was&#xD;
      performed, using RAFFAELLO 980 BIO - Dental Medical Technologies - DMT S.r.l. The tip of the&#xD;
      laser device was positioned on two areas for each dental element, located one in the center&#xD;
      of the cervical region and the other in the middle third of the crown. The parameters used&#xD;
      were: wavelength 980 nm, power 4 W, irradiation area1 cm2, application time 15 sec per 1 cm2,&#xD;

    <description>The efficacy of the treatment of dental hypersensitivity was evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), ranging from 0 to 10, with 0=no pain and 10= worst possible pain. The evaluation was performed at the following time points: before (T0) and after (T1) the first session, after the second session (T2) on the 7th day, after the third session (T3) on the 14th day and after 4 weeks from the starting (T4) on the 28th day.</description>
