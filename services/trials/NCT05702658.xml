  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of autistic adults reached 5.4 million in the United States in 2017 and is&#xD;
      projected to continue to rise, but evidence-based practices to optimize their health and&#xD;
      well-being are limited and poor outcomes are common. This study will leverage existing&#xD;
      infrastructure to finalize the development of a novel support service provided by peers with&#xD;
      lived experience, incorporating input from autistic peer specialists, autism researchers,&#xD;
      peer support researchers, and experts in peer support training. Investigators will then&#xD;
      conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of the service while&#xD;
      also examining the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation procedures in preparation&#xD;
      for future large-scale testing and dissemination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5.4 million adults in the United States (1 in 45) are believed to have autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorder (ASD), but there is a lack of services available to support them in&#xD;
      reaching their full potential. Although typically conceptualized as a childhood disorder,&#xD;
      ASD-related service needs persist into adulthood. The core social and communication&#xD;
      impairments of ASD, reported difficulties with change, and a high rate of co-occurring mental&#xD;
      health conditions often result in limited participation in major life areas that are&#xD;
      determinants of health, including social and community participation, employment, housing,&#xD;
      and transportation. The transition to adulthood is not only associated with developmental&#xD;
      challenges, but also a &quot;services cliff&quot; whereby supports and services that were previously&#xD;
      available through the education system are no longer available. Peer-delivered interventions&#xD;
      have emerged as a potent, evidence-based modality for enhancing outcomes among other clinical&#xD;
      populations, such as adults with serious mental illnesses, with effectiveness in enhancing&#xD;
      social networks, empowering participants, reducing the use of inpatient services, and&#xD;
      increasing life satisfaction. At present, there is limited research on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      autistic-led peer support interventions, especially those that target broad aspects of&#xD;
      community functioning. The proposed study seeks to refine, manualize, and test a pilot&#xD;
      autistic peer support program aimed at supporting community participation among autistic&#xD;
      young adults, with the goal of preparing it for large-scale testing and future dissemination&#xD;
      and sustainability. The first aim of this proposal is to enhance the structure of a pilot&#xD;
      autistic-peer delivered intervention (Community Autism Peer Specialists, or CAPS) that is&#xD;
      currently in use as a Medicaid-reimbursed service in Philadelphia. This will include&#xD;
      developing a manual and fidelity tool to facilitate evaluation and systematic implementation.&#xD;
      The second and third aims are to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with 40 young autistic adults to test the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention and research procedures, while also examining proposed&#xD;
      target mechanisms of action (e.g., self-efficacy, working alliance, perceived social support)&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes such as community participation, loneliness, and resilience. This work&#xD;
      will gather additional evidence and implementation information to support a fully-powered&#xD;
      R01- funded clinical trial. The proposed efforts will involve substantial engagement of a&#xD;
      diverse group of autistic adults in all phases along with multiple community partners,&#xD;
      including a Medicaid payer. The project has tremendous potential to expand service options&#xD;
      for autistic adults and is uniquely poised to have broad, scalable impact.&#xD;

    <description>The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale - 10 (CD-RISC) is the most frequently used instrument to measure resilience. The measure consists of 10 items using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not true at all) to 4 (true nearly all of the time). The scale measures how the participant felt over the past month. The questionnaire produces an overall resilience score that ranges from 0-40, with higher scores representing greater resilience.</description>
