  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise therapy has been shown to be effective in decreasing pain and improving function for&#xD;
      patients with recurrent low back pain (LBP). Research on the mechanisms that trigger and/or&#xD;
      underlie the effects of exercise therapy on LBP problems is of critical importance for the&#xD;
      prevention of recurring or persistence of this costly and common condition. One factor that&#xD;
      seems to be crucial within this context is the dysfunction of the back muscles. Recent&#xD;
      pioneering results have shown that individuals with recurring episodes of LBP have specific&#xD;
      dysfunctions of these muscles (peripheral changes) and also dysfunctions at the cortical&#xD;
      level (central changes). This work provides the foundation to take a fresh look at the&#xD;
      interplay between peripheral and central aspects, and its potential involvement in exercise&#xD;
      therapy. The current project will draw on this opportunity to address the following research&#xD;
      questions: What are the immediate (after a single session) and the long-term effects (after&#xD;
      18 repeated sessions) of exercise training on: (1) back muscle structure; (2) back muscle&#xD;
      function; (3) the structure of the brain; (4) and functional connectivity of the brain. This&#xD;
      research project also aims to examine whether the effects are dependent on how the training&#xD;
      was performed. Therefore a specific versus a general exercise program will be compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the cause of persistent non-specific LBP remains unknown, structural and functional&#xD;
      alterations of the brain and paravertebral muscles have been proposed as underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms. As it is hypothesized that these alterations contribute to, or maintain&#xD;
      non-specific LBP, exercise therapy is a key element in the rehabilitation of reoccurring LBP.&#xD;
      Specific training of sensorimotor control of the lumbopelvic region (i.e. specific skilled&#xD;
      motor training) has shown to decrease pain and disability in patients with LBP, but has not&#xD;
      been found superior to other forms of exercise training regarding improvements in clinical&#xD;
      outcome measures. On the other hand, this type of training seems to differentially impact the&#xD;
      recruitment of the back muscles compared to general exercise training. However, research&#xD;
      using multiple treatment sessions and including follow-up outcome assessments is scarce.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is unknown if improvements may be attributed to measurable peripheral changes&#xD;
      in the muscle and/or central neural adaptations in the brain. The primary aim of this study&#xD;
      is to examine the short and long-term effects of specific skilled motor control training&#xD;
      versus unspecific general extension training on pain, functional disability, brain&#xD;
      structure/function and muscle structure/function in recurrent LBP patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: In this double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial 62 recurrent LBP patients&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either specific skilled motor training (i.e. the&#xD;
      experimental group) or general extension training (i.e. control group). Each training group&#xD;
      will receive 13 weeks of treatment, during which a total of 18 supervised treatment sessions&#xD;
      will be delivered in combination with an individualized home-exercise program. Both groups&#xD;
      will first receive low-load training (i.e. at 25-30% of the individual's repetition maximum,&#xD;
      sessions 1-9) followed by high-load training (i.e. at 40-60% of the individual's one&#xD;
      repetition maximum, sessions 10-18). Primary outcome measures include: LBP-related pain and&#xD;
      disability (RMDQ, NRS and Margolis pain diagram), lumbar muscle structure and function (Dixon&#xD;
      MRI and mf-MRI) and brain structure and function (MRI, DTI and fMRI). Secondary measures&#xD;
      include: lumbopelvic control and proprioception (thoracolumbar dissociation test and&#xD;
      position-reposition test), trunk muscle activity (RAM and QFRT) and psychosocial factors,&#xD;
      including measures of physical activity (IPAQ-LF, SF-36), pain cognitions and perceptions&#xD;
      (PCS, PCI and PVAQ), anxiety and depression (HADS), and kinesiophobia (TSK). Experimental&#xD;
      data collection will be performed at baseline, immediately following the low-load training&#xD;
      (i.e. after the 9th supervised treatment session), following the high-load training (i.e.&#xD;
      after the 18th supervised treatment session), and at 3 months follow-up. Experimental data&#xD;
      collection will comprise of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and trunk muscles,&#xD;
      clinical assessments assessing muscle function, and a battery of questionnaires evaluating&#xD;
      psychosocial factors.&#xD;
