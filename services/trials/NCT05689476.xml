  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protective ventilatory strategy should be applied to reduce both ventilator-induced lung&#xD;
      injury (VILI) and ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD) after Lung Transplantation&#xD;
      (LTx). Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is an assisted ventilation mode in which&#xD;
      respiratory support is coordinated by the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi). Aim of&#xD;
      the study is to assess the physiological relationship between neural respiratory drive as&#xD;
      assessed by EAdi and tidal volume, driving pressure and mechanical power, at different levels&#xD;
      of ventilatory assist, in the absence of pulmonary vagal afferent feedback.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation (LTx) is an important treatment option for select patients with&#xD;
      end-stage pulmonary disease. In the early period following LTx a protective ventilatory&#xD;
      strategy should be applied to reduce both ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and&#xD;
      ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD) after Lung Tranplantation (LTx). Neurally&#xD;
      Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is an assisted ventilation mode in which neural&#xD;
      inspiratory activity is monitored through the continuous recording of electrical activity of&#xD;
      the diaphragm (EAdi) and then used to coordinate the respiratory support delivered by the&#xD;
      ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAVA, because of its intrinsic properties (proportionality between respiratory drive and&#xD;
      level of assist, prevention of diaphragm atrophy), could allow the aforementioned ventilatory&#xD;
      strategy, however it may require the integrity of the pulmonary vagal afferent feedback in&#xD;
      order to avoid volutrauma. So, the aim of the study is the evaluation of the physiological&#xD;
      relationship between EAdi and tidal volume, driving pressure and mechanical power, at&#xD;
      different levels of ventilatory assist, in the absence of pulmonary vagal afferent feedback,&#xD;
      in early post-operative period after LTx.&#xD;
