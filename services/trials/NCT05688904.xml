  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is testing the use of topical Imipramine in combination with&#xD;
      topical photodynamic therapy's (PDT) effect on pain following treatment. PDT is a commonly&#xD;
      used treatment in dermatology for patients who have many pre-cancers (actinic keratosis-AKs)&#xD;
      on their skin. These are both FDA-approved treatments, but this study is evaluating their use&#xD;
      in combination, which has not been evaluated in the past. The investigators have been doing&#xD;
      studies using animals that suggest that imipramine might make the PDT less painful and might&#xD;
      help it work better. In order to participate, the subject and their dermatologist have&#xD;
      decided that they would benefit from PDT to treat their skin due to many AK precancerous&#xD;
      lesions. Please note that neither PDT nor imipramine are experimental treatments, but&#xD;
      treating their skin with imipramine before PDT is a new approach.&#xD;
