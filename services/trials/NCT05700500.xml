  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the only study comparing the long-term results of these procedures (two years) is&#xD;
      that of Kim.(24) This study is the first randomized, blinded clinical trial comparing&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided percutaneous lavage ( UPL) for rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy with&#xD;
      subacromial injection vs. Shock (1000 impulses/0.36mJ/mm2), obtaining clinical improvement&#xD;
      and reabsorption of calcification in both groups. In this study, greater effectiveness was&#xD;
      observed in terms of pain improvement and functional recovery in these patients in the short&#xD;
      term than in those undergoing UPL: The results of this study were obtained through&#xD;
      radiographic evaluation (AP X-ray of the shoulder) before and after intervention and clinical&#xD;
      evaluation in both groups using the scales of the American Society of Shoulder and Elbow&#xD;
      Surgeons (ASES), the Simple Shoulder Test (SST) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our future work may add many interesting data to the comparative study of these two&#xD;
      techniques, since it would provide new results, overcoming the limitations of the only&#xD;
      similar study in the literature today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the one hand, the radiological selection of patients will be carried out with shoulder&#xD;
      X-rays and a shoulder ultrasound performed by two expert musculoskeletal radiologists from&#xD;
      this center and validated by interobserver correlation. This will allow a detailed selection&#xD;
      of patients according to the characteristics and phases of the calcification that they&#xD;
      present. Sonographically, calcifications are classified into three types (according to&#xD;
      Garner's 1993 classification): type I, II and III. As we have previously mentioned, calcific&#xD;
      tendinopathy is a self-limited disease and we know that calcifications in phase III or in the&#xD;
      resorption phase tend to resolve spontaneously. The control ultrasound that will be performed&#xD;
      on the patients will also be performed by the same expert musculoskeletal radiologists who&#xD;
      have performed the interobserver correlation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly , we are going to define a maximum number as well as the exact protocol for carrying&#xD;
      out the Eco - guided Puncture Lavage technique .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another contribution of our work is that we will carry out an evaluation of the differences&#xD;
      between both techniques up to two years post-treatment, which will allow us to know the&#xD;
      long-term evolution of the results.&#xD;

    <description>The calcification will be located by ultrasound. By injecting serum at high pressure, it is intended to wash away the calcification. A subacromial inyection will be associated with this procedure. A maximum of 3 Ultrasound-Guided Barbotage will be performed with an interval of 6 weeks between each puncture. This procedure will be performed by two experienced radiologists</description>
