  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected patients develop comorbidities earlier than the general population. Immune&#xD;
      activation with the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines would play a major role in the&#xD;
      occurrence of these comorbidities. Numerous factors, called risk factors, already identified&#xD;
      in the general population and confirmed in patients with HIV virus favor the occurrence of&#xD;
      these comorbidities but cannot alone explain the overrepresentation and precocity of these&#xD;
      comorbidities in the HIV population. Investigators hypothesize that optimization or&#xD;
      simplification with certain classes of antiretrovirals modify the inflammatory response and&#xD;
      are predictive factors for the occurrence of comorbidities&#xD;
