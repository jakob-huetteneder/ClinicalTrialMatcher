    <textblock>
      The goals of this study is to 1) evaluate feasibility and fidelity of a three-arm RCT&#xD;
      containing a twice-weekly exercise intervention supervised by a first-line (oncology)&#xD;
      physiotherapist and a 5-day weekly in-hospital exercise intervention versus usual care in&#xD;
      patients with rectal cancer or esophageal cancer receiving NCRT, and 2) generate preliminary&#xD;
      data on the variability in exercise responses on immune function, immune infiltration, and&#xD;
      vascularisation of the tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized in one of three study arms: 1) AE + RE - group; combined&#xD;
      moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise (AE) and resistance exercise (RE) twice a week&#xD;
      supervised by a specially trained first-line physiotherapist, and a home-based moderate&#xD;
      intensity aerobic exercise session once a week; 2) ExPR - group; in-hospital exercise&#xD;
      intervention consisting of 30 min moderate intensity aerobic exercise within one hour prior&#xD;
      to every radiotherapy session (five times a week); and 3) UC - group; a control group that&#xD;
      receives usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study parameters will be the feasibility in terms of trial participation rate and&#xD;
      attendance, and intervention fidelity (e.g. extend of and reasons for adaptations to the&#xD;
      exercise intervention). The secondary study parameters are the average effect sizes and&#xD;
      measures of variability on immune function, infiltration and vascularisation. Measurements&#xD;
      will take place at baseline, directly after finishing NCRT, and within a week before surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Strong evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) showed that physical exercise during&#xD;
      chemotherapy or radiotherapy benefits physical fitness, muscle mass, muscle strength,&#xD;
      fatigue, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Additionally, exercise may counteract&#xD;
      treatment-related side effects and help prevent treatment modifications, which might improve&#xD;
      survival. To date, the majority of RCTs examining the effects of exercise during cancer&#xD;
      treatment have been conducted in patients with breast cancer or prostate cancer who were&#xD;
      treated with curative intent. Due to differences in treatment trajectories and side effects,&#xD;
      generalisability of these findings to patients with other types of cancer is limited.&#xD;
      Additionally, widespread implementation of exercise in clinical cancer care is hampered by&#xD;
      the lack of knowledge of the exercise effects on clinical outcome, e.g. tumour recurrence,&#xD;
      progression and cancer-specific survival. Also, the causality and underlying physiological&#xD;
      and biological mechanisms linking exercise to clinical outcome are largely unknown. This&#xD;
      knowledge is essential to understand the potential and limitations of exercise as integral&#xD;
      part of cancer care and to further optimize exercise interventions. Pre-clinical studies have&#xD;
      shown that exercise can directly impact tumour growth and function as sensitizer for&#xD;
      anticancer treatment. However, it is unclear whether these results can be translated to&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment for patients with esophageal cancer and for a part of the patients with&#xD;
      rectal cancer includes neoadjuvant chemoradiation treatment (NCRT), followed by a 6 - 12&#xD;
      weeks or 8 - 10 weeks waiting period prior to surgical resection, respectively. NCRT might&#xD;
      reduce tumour size and even induce a pathological complete response. However, pathological&#xD;
      complete response rate after NCRT is relatively low for these patient populations: 15-20% for&#xD;
      rectal cancer and 30% for esophageal cancer. A part of patients with rectal cancer are&#xD;
      treated with radiotherapy (50 Gray in 25 fractions of 2 Gray) for five weeks combined with&#xD;
      the oral chemotherapy capecitabine. NCRT for patients with esophageal cancer includes&#xD;
      radiotherapy (41.4 Gray in 23 fractions for 5 days a week) combined with the intravenous&#xD;
      chemotherapies paclitaxel and carboplatin once a week for 5 weeks. Besides the curative value&#xD;
      of NCRT it may cause severe treatment-related side effects including diarrhoea, fatigue,&#xD;
      haematological toxicity, and neuropathy. Exercise training may counteract side effects such&#xD;
      as fatigue, neutropenia, neuropathy, and gastrointestinal problems (e.g. nausea) while&#xD;
      simultaneously improving physical fitness and HRQoL. Exercise frequency, intensity, timing&#xD;
      and type may impact the effects of the intervention. For example, aerobic exercise at higher&#xD;
      intensities may provide larger cardiovascular benefits, but may result in more&#xD;
      gastrointestinal side effects. Therefore, it is important to study whether exercise is&#xD;
      feasible during neoadjuvant chemoradiation, and whether exercise frequency, intensity, and&#xD;
      timing can induce different effects. Thus, more knowledge is needed on the feasibility and&#xD;
      effectivity of exercise prescriptions in patients with rectal or esophageal cancer, and the&#xD;
      robustness of the potential exercise-induced effects across patient populations. Improving&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment in these patients populations might enable more organ saving surgeries,&#xD;
      and increase survival rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential mechanisms of exercise training influencing clinical and pathological response In&#xD;
      addition to the well-established influence of physical exercise on physical fitness and the&#xD;
      HRQoL in patients with cancer, pre-clinical studies showed that exercise training can&#xD;
      directly influence tumour growth. To illustrate, studies in rodents revealed a few possible&#xD;
      mechanisms by which exercise training can influence tumour physiology, including&#xD;
      exercise-induced immune reactions, and alterations in vascularisation and perfusion of the&#xD;
      tumour. Studies in mice showed exercise-induced immune reactions, stimulated by the release&#xD;
      of epinephrine and the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 and epinephrine can initiate an&#xD;
      immune response which mobilises, activates and redistributes natural killer (NK) cells. These&#xD;
      processes have shown to stimulate the infiltration of activated NK cells in the tumour and to&#xD;
      reduce tumour growth. Secondly, in mouse-models, exercise training showed to induce a&#xD;
      'normalisation' of the intratumoural vasculature, reducing hypoxia and thereby improving the&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic efficiency. Both pathways might contribute to a more&#xD;
      rapid tumour regression. Due to differences between animal models and humans, including&#xD;
      feasible exercise levels, tumour characteristics, metabolic rates and potential&#xD;
      comorbidities, it is unclear whether these results can directly be translated to (wo)men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of studies in patients investigating mechanistic pathways of exercise-induced&#xD;
      tumour changes are scarce. Long-term exercise training as well as acute exercise bouts are&#xD;
      characterised by specific physiological responses leading to immediate and chronic&#xD;
      adaptations. Exploratory studies on exercise during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients&#xD;
      provided initial support for the hypothesis that exercise can modulate several host- and&#xD;
      tumour related pathways. These studies showed that exercise influenced circulating systemic&#xD;
      factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Tumour Necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±,&#xD;
      interleukins (ILs), and intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Due to the exercise-induced&#xD;
      release of circulating systemic anti-inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors, aerobic&#xD;
      training might improve immune activation in patients. Indeed, studies investigating the&#xD;
      immune system showed that acute exercise induces a mobilisation of NK cells (and an improved&#xD;
      NK-cell cytotoxicity in patients with cancer. In addition, data from our METRIC pilot trial&#xD;
      in 14 patients with breast or colon cancer, showed that a 9-week exercise intervention during&#xD;
      chemotherapy preserved NK-cell functionality (degranulation and cytotoxicity) compared to a&#xD;
      reduction in the usual care control group, with a 10% difference between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge there are only two clinical trials in patients who investigated the&#xD;
      influence of exercise training on tumour perfusion and vascularisation. In the study of Jones&#xD;
      et al. among women with breast cancer, only limited data was available for perfusion&#xD;
      assessments due to the relatively high proportion of patients with pathological complete&#xD;
      responses. The study of Florez Bedoya et al. in patients with pancreatic cancer showed an&#xD;
      increased number of vessels, elongated vessels, open vessels and an increased microvascular&#xD;
      density in the tumour of patients who received an exercise intervention compared to historic&#xD;
      control samples. Studies assessing changes in immune activation in the blood as well as&#xD;
      intra-tumoural vascularisation and immune infiltration after exercise training during NCRT&#xD;
      are non-existent in patients with rectal or esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another potential mechanism through which exercise may affect tumour response to NCRT in&#xD;
      patients with rectal cancer is an altered microbiome. At the pathology department of&#xD;
      Radboudumc, dr. Boleij and Prof. dr. Nagtegaal examine the mucosal and fecal microbiome in&#xD;
      relation to colorectal cancer development and disease progression using in situ detection&#xD;
      techniques and feces collections at multiple timepoints during disease trajectories. Exercise&#xD;
      may have a positive effect on the microbiome, by modifying the microbiota and increases&#xD;
      health-beneficial gut bacteria populations. An insight in changes in the microbiome after an&#xD;
      exercise intervention during NCRT might provide valuable information about the tumour&#xD;
      micro-environment. Hence, in this pilot study we want to exploratively include the collection&#xD;
      of feces in patients with rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the effects of exercise training after multiple sessions, pre-clinical studies showed&#xD;
      that the induced effects of one exercise bout might already interfere with mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying cancer progression and treatment response. Potential mechanisms for this acute&#xD;
      phenomenon include mild hyperthermia, augmented tumour perfusion, reduced tumour hypoxia, and&#xD;
      enhanced immune mobilisation. Even after one exercise bout these mechanisms may enhance&#xD;
      tumour oxygenation and immunity, which could potentially, driven by accumulative effects of&#xD;
      repeated acute exercise, result in improved radiotherapy efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An acute bout of exercise in healthy participants induces a large transient increase in&#xD;
      peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, including NK cells and CD8+ T cells. In addition, an&#xD;
      acute exercise bout can increase NK-cell cytotoxicity with 50 - 100%. Lymphocyte numbers&#xD;
      return to below pre-exercise values 1-2 hours after exercise, possibly reflecting a&#xD;
      redistribution of immune cells to peripheral tissue, which could be beneficial for immune&#xD;
      surveillance. It was shown that acute exercise in healthy individuals selectively mobilises&#xD;
      memory CD8+ T cells. Notably, Goedegebuure et al. showed that esophageal cancer patients&#xD;
      enriched with circulating CD8+ memory T cells prior to the start of treatment were more&#xD;
      likely to have a pathological complete response after NCRT. Also, high levels of CD8+ memory&#xD;
      T cell infiltration in the tumour are associated with a good prognosis in both esophageal and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the immune activation, pre-clinical studies showed that acute exercise might impact&#xD;
      the tumour perfusion and hypoxia. As reported above, several pre-clinical studies report more&#xD;
      patent and perfused vessels after exercise training, resulting in a larger and more&#xD;
      homogeneously perfused tumour area. An acute reduction in hypoxia might make the tumour more&#xD;
      sensitive to the radiotherapy. In addition, exercise-induced hyperthermia of the human body&#xD;
      might induce vasodilatation, increase perfusion and make the tumour more permissible for&#xD;
      immune cells. Consequently, linking the immune effects and perfusion effects of acute&#xD;
      exercise to radiotherapy efficacy reveals the possibility of acute exercise as&#xD;
      radiosensitizer. A close timing of an exercise session directly prior a radiotherapy session&#xD;
      might be beneficial for the radiotherapy response. Exercise prior to a radiotherapy session&#xD;
      was proven to be feasible and safe in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility and safety of an exercise intervention during NCRT in patients with rectal&#xD;
      cancer and esophageal cancer has been evaluated in previous studies. High adherence rates and&#xD;
      no adverse events related to the exercise intervention were reported in these studies, and&#xD;
      most reported barriers were willingness to participate and recruitment of patients. We&#xD;
      foresee that close collaborations with our multidisciplinary research team (e.g. clinical&#xD;
      researchers, clinicians,specially trained physiotherapists, tumour immunologist, pathologist)&#xD;
      and alignment of measurements with routine clinical practice will reduce these barriers.&#xD;
      These previous studies explored the effects of exercise interventions during neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy on physical activity, fitness, HRQoL, and post-operative complications. Additionally,&#xD;
      exploratory studies detected that exercise during NCRT in patients with rectal cancer and&#xD;
      esophageal cancer might lead to an augmented tumour regression. However, both in patients&#xD;
      with rectal and esophageal cancer, there is only one RCT investigating the feasibility of a&#xD;
      supervised exercise intervention during NCRT, and none of the currently performed studies&#xD;
      included investigations of underlying mechanisms of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge there is only one RCT evaluating the feasibility of aerobic exercise prior&#xD;
      to each radiotherapy session during concomitant chemoradiotherapy (24). This small trial in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer showed that pre-radiotherapy&#xD;
      exercise was safe and feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to conduct a three-arm pilot RCT in patients with rectal or esophageal cancer, while&#xD;
      simultaneously collecting data on the underlying mechanisms through which exercise can&#xD;
      influence tumour microenvironment. This pilot will investigate the feasibility of 1) AE + RT;&#xD;
      an exercise intervention consisting of two exercise sessions per week combining&#xD;
      moderate-to-high aerobic exercise (AE) and resistance exercise (RE) supervised by a&#xD;
      first-line specially educated physiotherapist, and one home-based moderate intensity aerobic&#xD;
      exercise session per week, 2) ExPR; in-hospital exercise intervention consisting of 30 min&#xD;
      moderate intensity aerobic exercise sessions within one hour prior to every radiotherapy&#xD;
      session (five times a week). Both interventions are similar in terms of weekly exercise&#xD;
      volume. Simultaneously, this pilot will gather preliminary data on measures of variability on&#xD;
      the potential efficacy of exercise on immune function, immune infiltration and&#xD;
      vascularisation of both exercise interventions. Additionally, we will evaluate the acute&#xD;
      immune response of one exercise session in patients in the ExPR group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge on the feasibility and preliminary results of the underlying mechanisms of exercise&#xD;
      regimes will be a first step towards improved supportive care for patients with rectal and&#xD;
      esophageal cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation. If the preliminary results on&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms are promising, we aim to write a grant application to set up a&#xD;
      sufficiently powered multi-centre randomized controlled trial in cooperation with other large&#xD;
      medical centres (e.g. Erasmus MC, Amsterdam UMC), focusing on the effects of exercise on&#xD;
      tumour responses and underlying mechanisms.&#xD;
