  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and the safety of vaginal misoprostol with&#xD;
      oral misoprostol for induction of labor in nulliparous pregnant women at or beyond completed&#xD;
      41 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labor is carried out for maternal and fetal indications and one of the most&#xD;
      common indications is prolonged pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have suggested that by continuing pregnancy beyond 41 weeks, there is&#xD;
      statistically significantly higher perinatal morbidity and mortality as well as an increased&#xD;
      risk to the mother. Thus, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting the elective&#xD;
      induction of labor at 41 weeks of gestation instead of expectant management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analog, is indicated for protection against gastric ulcers,&#xD;
      but when administered prenatally it causes uterine contractions. Research exploiting this&#xD;
      adverse effect has shown misoprostol to be superior to conventional methods for induction,&#xD;
      resulting in shorter induction-to-delivery intervals, without any increase in adverse&#xD;
      outcomes. It has the advantage of being cheap, stable at room temperature, and easy to be&#xD;
      administered by various routes i.e., vaginal, oral, sublingual, or rectal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differential outcomes of oral versus vaginal misoprostol may be secondary to different&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics for oral compared with vaginal misoprostol. Oral misoprostol undergoes rapid&#xD;
      absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and rapid and extensive de-esterification during&#xD;
      first-pass metabolism to an active metabolite, misoprostol, peaking at 15 minutes with a&#xD;
      half-life of 20-40 minutes. Misoprostol then undergoes early rapid elimination over 120&#xD;
      minutes, followed by slow elimination thereafter. The medication rapidly makes its way to the&#xD;
      myometrium. ln contrast, after vaginal misoprostol administration, plasma concentration&#xD;
      gradually increase, reaching a maximum level after 70-80 minutes before slowly being&#xD;
      eliminated with plasma levels still detectable 6 hours after administration.&#xD;
