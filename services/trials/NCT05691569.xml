  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Summary. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) represents a huge emotional&#xD;
      stress and an important burden for the patients and the caregivers severely reducing their&#xD;
      quality of life. BPSD worsen during hospitalization and require the administration of&#xD;
      psychotropic drugs that are often insufficient to control the symptoms, and may cause severe&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose the use of empathy dolls in order to reduce BPSD and in particular&#xD;
      agitation and aggressiveness in acute geriatric in-patients affected by moderate to severe&#xD;
      forms of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of doll therapy in the clinical routine will allow to reduce the use of psychotropic&#xD;
      drugs, shorten hospitalization, reduce professional and family caregiver burden improving&#xD;
      patients' and families' quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>Staff Stress Measure Dementia Care (SSMDC). The scale comprised the following 27 items producing a five-factor solution: Frustrated empathy; difficulties understanding and interpreting; balancing competing needs; balancing emotional involvement; and lack of recognition.</description>

    <measure>family caregiver burden</measure>

    <description>Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) scale. The Caregiver Burden Inventory comprises 24 closed questions divided into five dimensions: time-dependence, developmental, physical, social and emotional burden. There are five items in each dimension except for physical burden, which has four items dedicated to. Each item is given a score between 0 (not at all descriptive) and 4 (very descriptive), where higher scores indicate greater caregiver burden; there are no cut-off points for classifying burden. Therefore, total scores for factors one, two, four and five can range from zero to 20. An equivalent score for physical burden can be obtained by multiplying the sum of items in this dimension by 1.25</description>
