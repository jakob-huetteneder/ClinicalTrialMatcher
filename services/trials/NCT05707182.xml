    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the usefulness of PET/MRI with an investigational&#xD;
      radioactive drug, 18F-rhPSMA-7.3, and MRI contrast in evaluating patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer eligible for active surveillance. This study is for imaging purposes only and is not a&#xD;
      treatment study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in American men with the majority&#xD;
      of men diagnosed with PSA-based screening. As such, many will be found to have low-risk&#xD;
      disease when detected early in the disease course. Whole gland radical therapies with primary&#xD;
      curative intent are typically invasive and incur a recognized risk of morbidity, particularly&#xD;
      in regards to urinary and sexual quality of life measures. For this reason, patients with&#xD;
      competing comorbidities or low risk disease have increasingly approached management with&#xD;
      active surveillance. The use of active surveillance has increased significantly, particularly&#xD;
      in those patients with low-volume, low-grade prostate cancer. For these surveillance&#xD;
      protocols, serial PSA biomarker evaluation and periodic repeat prostate biopsies are&#xD;
      scheduled to assess for grade or stage progression which may redirect management toward&#xD;
      curative treatment options within the window for cure. Since the advent of prostate&#xD;
      indication multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) and its use to target areas of suspicion for biopsy&#xD;
      sampling, MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy has been used in the setting of patients with active&#xD;
      surveillance to better characterize disease risk stratification for confirmatory biopsy&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the advances mpMRI has offered, its sensitivity for detection of clinically&#xD;
      significant prostate cancer is insufficient to replace biopsy at both initial diagnosis and&#xD;
      during active surveillance. Additionally, although MRI-TRUS fusion has improved detection of&#xD;
      clinically significant cancers, it is known that a fraction of prostate cancers remain occult&#xD;
      on mpMRI. Various PSMA radiotracers have been explored as an alternative to mpMRI for the&#xD;
      detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. Many of these studies utilize PET/CT,&#xD;
      which does not take advantage of the vast superiority of mpMRI over CT and limits their&#xD;
      ability to detect clinically significant prostate cancer. However, early studies utilizing&#xD;
      PET/MRI (in which the sensitivity of the exam for clinically significant cancer is improved&#xD;
      by both the PET and MRI components) have shown promising results. While these studies have&#xD;
      explored the role of PSMA-PET/MRI in lesion detection and biopsy guidance, there is little&#xD;
      data regarding its use in the setting of active surveillance.&#xD;
