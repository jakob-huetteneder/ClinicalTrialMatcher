  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of temozolomide and M1774 and&#xD;
      how well they works in treating patients with cancer that has spread from where it first&#xD;
      started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic) and may have spread to nearby&#xD;
      tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Temozolomide is in a class of&#xD;
      medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (DNA) and may kill tumor cells and slow down or stop tumor growth. M1774 may stop the growth&#xD;
      of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Adding M1774 to&#xD;
      temozolomide may shrink or stabilize cancer for longer than temozolomide alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of temozolomide (TMZ) and&#xD;
      tuvusertib (M1774).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine the overall response rate.&#xD;
      III. To estimate progression free survival. IV. To estimate overall survival. V. To determine&#xD;
      the recommended phase 2 dose of the combination of TMZ and M1774.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the response rate in O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)&#xD;
      methylated tumors compared to non-methylated tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Correlate MGMT promoter hypermethylation, MGMT expression and tumor-infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes (TILs) with efficacy endpoints of response rate, progression free survival, and&#xD;
      overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess pre and post treatment tumor biopsies for changes in tumor mutational burden,&#xD;
      tumor associated neo-antigens and microsatellite status by whole exome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Measure changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell populations with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess liquid biopsies by circulating tumor (ct)DNA for changes in tumor mutational&#xD;
      burden and microsatellite status by whole exome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of temozolomide and tuvusertib followed by&#xD;
      a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tuvusertib orally (PO) and temozolomide PO on study. Patients undergo&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), biopsy, and collection of blood&#xD;
      samples on study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of&#xD;

             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of M1774 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because ATR inhibitors agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial&#xD;
             are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to&#xD;
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or&#xD;
             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the&#xD;
             study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of M1774&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; Grade 1) with the exception of alopecia and&#xD;
             neuropathy, which may be =&lt; grade 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions or hypersensitivity attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to M1774 or temozolomide, including dacarbazine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M1774 is an ATR inhibiting agent&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with M1774 breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother&#xD;
             is treated with M1774. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior history of ataxia telangiectasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not able to swallow orally administered medication or have&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot discontinue proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). H-2-receptor antagonist&#xD;
             and antacids should be held during the 7 days of concurrent dosing with M1774. There&#xD;
             is no H-2-receptor antagonist or antacid restriction during the time without M1774&#xD;
             dosing.&#xD;
