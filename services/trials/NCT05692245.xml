      The goal of this clinical trial is to compare medications in women having a cesarean&#xD;
      delivery. The main question it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Which medication is better to use as a first-line prevention agent for nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      Participants will rate their nausea, pain and other symptoms after surgery Researchers will&#xD;
      compare two drugs, ondansetron and dexamethasone to see if the side effects of pain&#xD;
      medications are improved after cesarean.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean delivery is the most common surgical procedure performed in the United States, with&#xD;
      approximately 1.2 million cesarean deliveries performed in 2020.(1) Cesarean delivery is&#xD;
      preferentially performed under neuraxial anesthesia (spinal or epidural anesthesia) to allow&#xD;
      mothers to be awake during the delivery of their child and to improve maternal safety.&#xD;
      Despite the routine use of neuraxial techniques for most cesarean deliveries in the United&#xD;
      States, many patients experience nausea and/or vomiting either during surgery (intraoperative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting, IONV) or after surgery (postoperative nausea and vomiting, PONV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PONV has traditionally been associated with female gender, history of motion sickness,&#xD;
      nonsmoking status, and opioid use.(2) Other authors have shown increased PONV risk with&#xD;
      younger age, type of surgery, and general anesthesia as opposed to regional or neuraxial&#xD;
      anesthesia.(3,4) Intrathecal opioids, are the gold standard for pain relief after cesarean&#xD;
      delivery, and are part of the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology's (SOAP)&#xD;
      Early Recover After Cesarean (ERAC) guideline. However, these medications have been&#xD;
      implicated in increased rates of PONV.(5) Given the prevalence of cesarean delivery and the&#xD;
      importance of maternal well-being, prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting remains an important&#xD;
      issue to address.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications from multiple classes are commonly administered to prevent and treat PONV after&#xD;
      cesarean delivery. These include 5-HT3 antagonists, dopaminergic antagonists,&#xD;
      corticosteroids, antihistamines, and anticholinergics. Ondansetron, a 5HT3 antagonist, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, are among the most commonly administered medications due to&#xD;
      their efficacy and long track record of safety during pregnancy. Indeed, the SOAP ERAC&#xD;
      guideline recommends that at least two agents from different classes be administered&#xD;
      perioperatively to decrease the rates of IONV and PONV.(6) They further suggest&#xD;
      metoclopramide for IONV prophylaxis, ondansetron or dexamethasone for PONV prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of ondansetron and dexamethasone are further supported by a 2021&#xD;
      Cochrane Systematic review analyzing medical prophylaxis against IONV and PONV in cesarean&#xD;
      delivery.(6) Both ondansetron and dexamethasone decreased postoperative nausea (Ond: RR 0.45;&#xD;
      10 RCT, 1340 total subjects; Dex: RR 0.59; 6 studies, 733 women) and vomiting rates (Ond: RR&#xD;
      0.47, 10 studies, 1450 women; Dex: RR 0.68; 7 RCT, 793 women). No adverse events from 5HT3&#xD;
      blocking agents or corticosteroids were identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is intriguing as a first-line agent for cesarean delivery since it may have the&#xD;
      added benefit of improved pain control and/or decreased postoperative opioid requirement.&#xD;
      Several studies have addressed the role of dexamethasone in pain management. A 2008 study by&#xD;
      Jaafarpour et al.(8) found a decrease in composite rates of nausea and vomiting, as well&#xD;
      reduction of ~1 point on the VAS pain scale for 24 hours following surgery. Data from other&#xD;
      studies have been mixed (9, 10, 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, there is a gap in knowledge in defining the optimal first-line antiemetic for&#xD;
      prophylaxis of PONV in patients undergoing cesarean delivery. Our goal is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of ondansetron vs. dexamethasone on PONV rates and postoperative pain control.&#xD;
