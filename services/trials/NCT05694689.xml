  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare supplementation with vitamin D at 800 IU/day to&#xD;
      usual care for the first 28 days after birth with respect to 25 (OH) vitamin D levels and&#xD;
      indicators of likely or plausible effects of vitamin D supplementation on the function or&#xD;
      structure of the lung, bones, immune system, and brain in extremely premature (EP) infants&#xD;
      who are &lt;28 weeks gestational age (GA) or &lt;1000 grams of birth weight (BW). The study results&#xD;
      will be analyzed as intention to treat Bayesian analyses (Frequentist analyses will also be&#xD;
      performed).&#xD;

    <description>Infants will receive cholecalciferol 800 IU/day in the first 28 days after birth, given enterally four times per day (0.5mL per dose = 200 IU) until the infant is provided 400 IU/day.

    <description>800 IU/day Vitamin D supplementation until 400 IU/ day are provided as part of usual care. At that point the intervention becomes a supplement of 400 IU/day above that given with usual care.
