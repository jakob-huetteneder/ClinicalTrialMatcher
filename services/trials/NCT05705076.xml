      Direct Oral Anticoagulants&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOAC's looks like an attractive alternative to VKA because they offer important advantages&#xD;
      beyond their easiness of administration, like less interactions and no need of laboratory&#xD;
      monitoring. 1 All oral anticoagulant regimens but not aspirin were associated with a lower&#xD;
      risk of recurrent VTE, while only VKAs were associated with a higher risk of major bleeding.&#xD;
      2 There have been significant differences between VKAs and DOACs in the risk of major&#xD;
      bleeding by the current study size. Even though the risk of major bleeding with VKAs may be&#xD;
      lower in patients already challenged to anticoagulation treatment. 3 Furthermore, when&#xD;
      deciding on longer term secondary prevention of VTE, DOACs appeared safer than&#xD;
      standard-intensity VKAs, taking clinically relevant bleeding or any bleeding into&#xD;
      consideration.4-5 Until now there is no randomized controlled trial assessing the role of&#xD;
      oral direct anticoagulant as a prophylaxis for catheter associated venous thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work: To evaluate the efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants as a prophylactic&#xD;
      anticoagulation in thromboprophylaxis of catheter induced thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods Study location: The study will be conducted at the department of&#xD;
      vascular surgery in Mansoura University, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: Randomized Controlled Prospective study Study duration: 2 years: 2022-2024&#xD;
      Sample size: It will include all patients presented to our department fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study will be conducted in patients with any permanent catheter&#xD;
      inserted intravenous either femoral or jugular either for hemodialysis or replacement therapy&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Any permanent catheter inserted intravenous either femoral or jugular&#xD;
      either for hemodialysis, replacement or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: History of central venous occlusion, contraindication of direct oral&#xD;
      anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent: Patients must sign informed consent about possible complications from the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: The demographics, symptoms, and preoperative clinical data will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History Data: including underlying medical conditions, any previous associated morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination: Venous examinations. Laboratory: Blood picture, Blood sugar level, Kidney&#xD;
      functions, Liver functions and Coagulation profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging: Duplex US Method of Randomization: Computer-based Therapies group A : Apixaban 2.5&#xD;
      mg twice group B : Rivaroxaban 10 mg plus placebo group C : Placebo without anticoagulation&#xD;
      Follow up All patients are followed by duplex ultrasonography to assess the thrombosis at the&#xD;
      tip of catheter or around the catheter 10 days postoperative and 1, 3, 6, months then after&#xD;
      one year, venography is indicated if the clinical evaluation not matched with sonographic&#xD;
      results.&#xD;

      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Â· The data will be analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The numerical&#xD;
      outcomes e.g. age is calculated as mean. Gender will be recorded as frequency and percentage.&#xD;
      Chi Square test is applied to assess the association of various parameters. The results will&#xD;
      be considered statistically significant if the p-value is found to be less than or equal to&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
