    <description>PDNO will be administered as an incremental intravenous infusion of respectively 15 minutes with the planned dosage: 3, 10, 30, 45 and 60 nmol/kg/min. If no effect on MPAP/PVR is seen at 60 nmol/kg/min in the first patients treated, further dose escalation up to 120 nmol/kg/min is possible, if recommended by the Internal Safety Review Committe (iSRC) following careful review of collected safety data. The iSRC will in any case review all collected data after 4, 8 and 12 patients (if applicable also after 16 and 20 patients). PDNO is administered together with a carrier buffer (NaHCO3-) flow into a central venous catheter. Placebo (NaCl, commercially available dilution solution for parenteral use, 9 mg/mL) will be administered during the baseline and washout observation periods before and after start of IMP infusion.</description>

    <description>PDNO consists of propylene glycol (1,2-propanediol, PD) chemically combined with NO (to be donated). The drug substance is formulated as an inherent mixture of 4 structure analogues. The mixture consists of an equilibrium of the 2 regioisomers 1-(nitrosooxy) propan-2-ol and 2-(nitrosooxy) propan-1-ol. In addition, each regioisomer is a racemic mixture.</description>
