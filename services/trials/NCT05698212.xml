  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is testing a way to diagnose endometriosis using a uterine tissue biopsy (similar&#xD;
      to a pap smear) as opposed to undergoing laparoscopy surgery. The tissue is sent to lab for&#xD;
      cellular analysis with a proprietary AI (artificial intelligence) technology.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves 2 visits to the site and possibly as outpatient surgical center, and the&#xD;
      participant will be involved in the for as little as 1 day to as much as 60 days, mainly&#xD;
      depending on scheduling of laparoscopy. Eligible participants in the active group will have&#xD;
      history of endometriosis and will be having a laparoscopy for diagnosis within the next few&#xD;
      weeks. Eligible participants in the control group will have no history of endometriosis but&#xD;
      will need or have recently had a laparoscopy surgical procedure for a reasons such as tubal&#xD;
      ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will have an uterine biopsy (similar to a pap smear) in the physician's&#xD;
      office before the laparoscopy. The biopsied tissue will be sent to a special lab for analysis&#xD;
      and diagnosis of endometriosis by an innovative proprietary procedure that analyses the cells&#xD;
      of the tissue collected in the biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the biopsy will be compared to the laparoscopy for accuracy.&#xD;
