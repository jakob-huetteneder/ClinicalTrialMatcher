  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), as an ideal lung protection ventilation&#xD;
      method, has been gradually applied to neonatal intensive care treatment, and is currently&#xD;
      recommended as a rescue method for neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after&#xD;
      failure of conventional mechanical ventilation. Although its ability to improve oxygenation&#xD;
      and enhance carbon dioxide (CO2) clearance has been repeatedly demonstrated in laboratory&#xD;
      studies, its impact on the clinical results of these patients is still uncertain. Noninvasive&#xD;
      high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (nHFOV) combines the advantages of HFOV and&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation, and has become the current research focus in this field. It is&#xD;
      recommended to use it after the failure of routine non-invasive ventilation treatment to&#xD;
      avoid intubation. For the treatment of intubation, there is still a lack of large-scale&#xD;
      clinical trials to systematically explore its efficacy. The gradual increase of clinical&#xD;
      application of nHFOV has also enriched its application in the treatment of other diseases. At&#xD;
      present, non-invasive high-frequency oscillatory ventilation has not been applied to the&#xD;
      study of adult COVID-19 with acute hypoxemia, which will be the first study in this field.&#xD;

    <description>Asynchrony index is defined as the number of asynchrony events divided by the total respiratory rate computed as the sum of the number of ventilator cycles (triggered or not) and of wasted efforts: asynchrony Index (expressed in percentage) = number of asynchrony events/total respiratory rate (ventilator cycles +wasted efforts) × 100</description>

    <description>The day before the test, the patient was titrated with the oxygen concentration under non-invasive ventilation. The non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure ventilation was used, the pressure was set at 8cmH2O, and the oxygen concentration was titrated when the blood oxygen saturation was greater than 92% during non-invasive ventilation, and the oxygen concentration in the respiratory tube was constant after the test. In non-invasive high-frequency oscillatory ventilation mode, maintain the same positive airway pressure setting, and superimpose high-frequency oscillatory airflow with amplitude of 6cmH2O and oscillatory frequency of 10HZ.</description>
