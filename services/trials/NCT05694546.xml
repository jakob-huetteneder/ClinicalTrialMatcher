  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early post-discharge mortality is high among Zambians living with HIV admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital. This may be due to missed opportunities in post-discharge care, such as inadequate&#xD;
      follow-up and treatment. In this study the investigators will develop and pilot a new&#xD;
      approach to post-discharge HIV care to improve care coordination and treatment adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many people living with HIV (PLHIV) have poor outcomes following hospitalization, including&#xD;
      high mortality, readmission, and gaps in HIV care engagement. This is likely multi-factorial&#xD;
      and not all etiologies may be modifiable. While high mortality may due to incurable cancer,&#xD;
      the majority of deaths in PLHIV are thought to be caused by infectious diseases for which&#xD;
      treatments exist. However, succumbing to these life-threatening infections after discharge&#xD;
      may be due to poor understanding of discharge instructions, lack of post hospital care, and&#xD;
      poor understanding of required follow up. Psychosocial support also plays a role in the&#xD;
      mental and physical health of these sick patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ReCharge 1, the investigators gathered formative data and identified at least three major&#xD;
      factors that undermine HIV clinical outcomes after hospital discharge. First, there are gaps&#xD;
      in continuity of care between the discharging facility and outpatient. Second, support from&#xD;
      family is often suboptimal due to lack of understanding on the cause of illness, lack of HIV&#xD;
      status disclosure, and the cost of care. Third, HIV comorbidities may underpin or complicate&#xD;
      the immediate reason for discharge or the post-discharge engagement in care. These data were&#xD;
      disseminated to local experts in Zambia including from the Ministry of Health and used to&#xD;
      create a new care model for post-discharge HIV care. The care model draws from other&#xD;
      successful programs in Zambia. In ReCharge 2 the investigators now propose to pilot the&#xD;
      program and assess feasibility, acceptability, and potential for clinical impact.&#xD;
