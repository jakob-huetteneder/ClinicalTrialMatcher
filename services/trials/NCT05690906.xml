      This phase II prospective, multicenter, randomized, parallel-controlled, superiority clinical&#xD;
      study will select more than three hospitals with national clinical trial institution&#xD;
      qualifications as clinical trial centers, plan to recruit 100 subjects, 50 in experimental&#xD;
      group and 50 in control. The patients in expermental group will receive brachytherapy after&#xD;
      the hydrogel injection while patients in control group will receive brachytherapy without&#xD;
      hydrogel. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the use of ReSpace™ hydrogel results&#xD;
      in a reduction of radiation exposure to the anterior rectum, and to assess its safety.&#xD;
