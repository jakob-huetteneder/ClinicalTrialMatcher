      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effects of peripheral focous-out glasses on&#xD;
      emmetropization in non-myopic Chinese Children Aged 6-8 Years.This is a prospective,&#xD;
      parallel-controlled randomized trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myopia is one of the most common eye diseases that cause visual impairment and blindness, and&#xD;
      the high rate of myopia in young people is a major public health issue. Based on the clinical&#xD;
      studies of optical defocusing to regulate eye growth and refractive changes through visual&#xD;
      signal feedback, we hypothesize that early wearing of peripheral defocus glasses in children&#xD;
      can slow down the process of emmetropization and even prevent the onset of myopia by&#xD;
      producing more myopic defocusing. The aim of this study is to investigate whether wearing&#xD;
      peripheral defocus glasses can effectively delay emmetropization in non-myopic children aged&#xD;
      6-8 years , and to further explore its effect on preventing the onset of myopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study adopts a 2-year，single-centre, randomized, parallel-controlled trial with a&#xD;
      non-blinded design. Subjects who pass the screening period will have their baseline data&#xD;
      collected and will be assigned to the experimental or control groups according to the&#xD;
      randomization principle. The experimental group will be fitted with Direct Emmetropia with&#xD;
      Focus-out Glasses (hereafter referred to as DEFOG) to guide the emmetropization process. The&#xD;
      control group will be given no treatment and will be a blank control. Baseline data including&#xD;
      visual acuity, cycloplegic objective refraction, axis length, accommodation amplitude,&#xD;
      strabismus examination, pupil size, choroidal thickness and peripheral retinal refraction&#xD;
      will be measured when enrolled in the group and follow-up data will be measured at month 6,&#xD;
      12, 18 and 24. The primary interest of this study will be studied by comparing the difference&#xD;
      in cycloplegic objective refraction changes between month 24 and baseline in the two groups&#xD;
      of subjects.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From baseline till the 24th month</time_frame>
    <description>Changes of cycloplegic objective refraction from baseline till the 24th month (only the right-eye data included). Objective refraction data will be examined by AUTO REF/KERATOMETER. Ciliary muscle paralysis will be performed by using 1% cyclopentanone eye drops, 2 doses in each eye, 2 doses 5 minutes apart. The optometry will be performed after 20 minutes of complete ciliary muscle paralysis (disappearance of pupil response to light or pupil diameter at least greater than 6 mm). Baseline data will be measured at the time of enrollment. Follow-up data will be measured on the 24th month from baseline. The 24th month data will be subtracted from the baseline data to obtain changes.</description>
