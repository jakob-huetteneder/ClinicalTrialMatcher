  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate the effectiveness of MINDful TIME, an 8-week mindfulness-based&#xD;
      program designed to improve mental health in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and&#xD;
      their caregivers. MINDful TIME includes weekly psychoeducational group meetings conducted&#xD;
      through videoconferencing and use of a commercially available mindfulness meditation app. We&#xD;
      predict that adolescents in the mindfulness intervention group will demonstrate increases in&#xD;
      self-reported mindfulness and reductions in self- and parent-reported anxiety and depression&#xD;
      relative to a delayed treatment control group. We will also explore whether caregivers in the&#xD;
      treatment group demonstrate improvements in quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interested individuals and their parent/caregiver who meet preliminary eligibility criteria&#xD;
      during the phone screen will be scheduled for a 1-2 hour virtual study visit to complete an&#xD;
      intake interview for study and a brief IQ test. If individuals have completed this assessment&#xD;
      at SARRC within the last five years, they will not be re-assessed; however, they will&#xD;
      complete a 30-minute virtual intake visit to complete the intake interview, learn about the&#xD;
      intervention and determine if they would like to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the treatment group will complete three virtual study visits (Baseline,&#xD;
      intervention exit, 2-month follow-up), whereas participants in the delayed treatment control&#xD;
      group will complete four virtual study visits (Baseline, wait for the period exit,&#xD;
      intervention exit, 2 month-follow-up). After completing their second-time point (i.e., wait&#xD;
      period exit) participants in the delayed treatment control group will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      8-week intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that the duration of an individual participant's participation in the study&#xD;
      from baseline data collection to study completion will be approximately 6 months.&#xD;
      Participants may be enrolled up to 8 months prior to their baseline data collection depending&#xD;
      on when they are recruited into the study and whether they participate in cohort 1 or cohort&#xD;
      2.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will include weekly 90-minute group meetings held online through Zoom. Adolescents and parents will meet in separate groups and will learn about mindfulness-based strategies that can be used to manage and reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. They will also learn evidence-based strategies to complete daily guided mindfulness meditations using Ten Percent Happier, a commercially-available mobile app. Participants will be encouraged to meditate using the mobile app for at least 10 minutes each day during and after the 8-week intervention.</description>
