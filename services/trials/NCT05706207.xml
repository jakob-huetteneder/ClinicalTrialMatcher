  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ia single-center, open-label, dose escalation study.The objectives of this&#xD;
      study are to evaluate the safety, toxicity, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics(PK/PD), immunogenicity, biomarkers, and antitumor activity&#xD;
      of HB0030 in advanced solid tumor subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase Ia study will enroll up to 19-36 subjects with advanced solid tumor who have&#xD;
      progressing tumor after standard therapy and have no better treatment option.The conventional&#xD;
      3+3 design will be applied for dose escalation.This study will set up 8 dose groups.HB0030&#xD;
      injection is administered once every 3 weeks.&#xD;
