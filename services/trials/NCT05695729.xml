      Bowling action is a highly skilled activity acquired over the year. A bowler needs speed and&#xD;
      strength to challenge the batsman but the conventional protocols they follow for the speed&#xD;
      and strength are not specific to their bowling actions. Bowling can result in different types&#xD;
      of upper extremity injuries, such as rotator cuff sprains, impingement and stress fractures.&#xD;
      There are many injury prevention programs such as electrostimulation training, resistance&#xD;
      training, and plyometric training that can be used to treat upper limb injuries and improve&#xD;
      maximal strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plyometric training can be done by overhead athletes to improve the effectiveness of throwing&#xD;
      activity and to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles to prevent shoulder injury from overhead&#xD;
      throwing activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of upper limb plyometric exercises on speed,&#xD;
      strength and injury prevention in comparison with conventional exercises.&#xD;

    <description>Seated power throw (medicine ball) will be used to assess strength and explosive power of the upper body. The athlete sits on the floor with his legs fully extended, feet 24 inches (~60 cm) apart and with the back against a wall. The ball is held with the hands on the side and slightly behind the centre and back against the centre of the chest. The forearms are positioned parallel to the ground. The athlete throws the medicine ball vigorously as far straight forward as he can while maintaining the back against the wall. The distance thrown is recorded.</description>

    <description>DASH questionnaire (Reliability: ICC = 0.96, Validity: r &gt; 0.70) It is a 30-item questionnaire that look the ability of a patient to perform certain upper extremity activities. This is a self-report questionnaire that patient can rate difficulty and interference with daily life on a 5-point Likert chart.</description>
