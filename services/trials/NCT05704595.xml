  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the OUTPATIENT-WHF study is to characterize the effectiveness of outpatient&#xD;
      intravenous diuretic therapy as a treatment for worsening heart failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treating certain patients with worsening&#xD;
      heart failure as an outpatient with intravenous and oral medications can work just as well as&#xD;
      treating patients in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who enter into the study and meet eligibility criteria will be randomly chosen&#xD;
      to either get intravenous diuretic like Lasix in the clinic and get outpatient care, versus&#xD;
      directly admitted to the hospital to receive intravenous diuretic and normal hospital care.&#xD;

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ5D utility index consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five response categories (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems), from which a single EQ-5D index score can be calculated ranging from 0 (dead) to 1 (perfect health).</description>
