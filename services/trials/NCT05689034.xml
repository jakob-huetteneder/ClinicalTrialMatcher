      To investigate whether treatment with Azvudine reduces the risk of severe illness or death in&#xD;
      patients who are at a potential risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, in&#xD;
      which all participants will be randomized to a test group or control group in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test group will be given Azvudine in combination with conventional therapy excluding&#xD;
      anti-viral therapy and observed for efficacy. The control group will be given placebo in&#xD;
      combination with conventional therapy excluding anti-viral therapy and observed for efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Group will recruit 548 participants who will be given Azvudine + conventional therapy&#xD;
      other than antiviral*5 mg/day, oral, up to 7 days (1 mg/tablet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group will recruit 548 who will be given Placebo + conventional therapy other than&#xD;
      antiviral* 5 tablets/day, oral, up to 7 days.&#xD;
