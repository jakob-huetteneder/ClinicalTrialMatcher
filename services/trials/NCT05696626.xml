  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      combination of lasofoxifene and abemaciclib compared with that of fulvestrant and abemaciclib&#xD;
      for the treatment of Pre- and Postmenopausal Women and Men with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer who have disease progression on an AI in combination with&#xD;
      either palbociclib or ribociclib as their first hormonal treatment for metastatic disease and&#xD;
      who have an ESR1 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question the study aims to answer is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To compare the efficacy of the combination of lasofoxifene and abemaciclib with that of&#xD;
      fulvestrant and abemaciclib Participants will receive either receive 5 mg/d of oral&#xD;
      lasofoxifene plus oral abemaciclib 150 mg twice a day or the combination of fulvestrant 500&#xD;
      mg intramuscular (IM) on Days 1, 15, and 29 and then once monthly thereafter plus oral&#xD;
      abemaciclib 150 mg twice a day.&#xD;
