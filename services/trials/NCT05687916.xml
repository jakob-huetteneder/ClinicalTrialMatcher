  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim is to evaluate the effect of TAK-861 on symptoms of narcolepsy, including&#xD;
      excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) as measured by sleep latency from the Maintenance of&#xD;
      Wakefulness Test (MWT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 60 participants and they will be randomly assigned to 3&#xD;
      groups (20 per group) to take one of two different doses of TAK-861 or a placebo. All the&#xD;
      participants will receive the treatment for 8 weeks. Participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      some questionnaires during the study. This trial will be conducted in North America, Europe,&#xD;
      and Asia Pacific.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-861. TAK-861 is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have narcolepsy without cataplexy [Narcolepsy Type 2 (NT2)]. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 2 oral doses of TAK-861.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 60 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by&#xD;
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups-which will remain&#xD;
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent&#xD;
      medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-861 Dose 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-861 Dose 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has&#xD;
           no active ingredient&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center trial to be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in&#xD;
      this study is approximately 18 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 8 in Mean Sleep Latency From the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The MWT evaluates a person's ability to remain awake under soporific conditions for a defined period of time. Because there is no biological measure of wakefulness, wakefulness is measured indirectly by the inability or delayed tendency to fall asleep. This tendency to fall asleep is measured via electroencephalography-derived sleep latency in the MWT. The MWT consists of four 40-minute sessions done 2 hours apart. Sleep latency in each session will be recorded. Participants will be required to stay awake in between the 4 sessions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 8 in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS provides individuals with 8 different situations of daily life and asks them how likely they are to fall asleep in those situations (scored 0 to 3) and to try to imagine their likelihood of dozing even if they have not actually been in the identical situation; the scores are summed to give an overall score of 0 to 24. Higher scores indicate stronger subjective daytime sleepiness, and scores below 10 are considered to be within the normal range.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Experience at Least one Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to approximately 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product. A TEAE is defined as any event emerging or manifesting at or after the initiation of treatment with a study intervention or medicinal product or any existing event that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the study intervention or medicinal product.</description>
