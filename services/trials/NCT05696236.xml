  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is testing a new way to look for the early stages of anaphylaxis.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will have a small monitor (transepidermal water loss) placed on the&#xD;
      forearm during a food challenge (for peanut allergies). This monitor continuously records the&#xD;
      amount of water lost through the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study the team learned what values are associated with an anaphylactic&#xD;
      reaction. These values are called &quot;stopping rules.&quot; This study is looking at whether it can&#xD;
      use these new stopping rules to end the oral food challenge before a person may show any&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a known history of food anaphylaxis to peanut confirmed by an allergist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had skin and blood food allergy testing to peanut within the past 6 months. Meet&#xD;
             the 80% likelihood positive predictive value threshold for peanut allergy based on at&#xD;
             least 1 of either the skin or blood immunoglobulin E (IgE) tests per current&#xD;
             literature corrected for age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meet all clinical oral food challenge (OFC) requirements. This includes no asthma or&#xD;
             atopic dermatitis exacerbations, no recent viral infections, no recent antibiotics,&#xD;
             and no food allergy reactions in the past month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known cardiovascular disease, cancer, pulmonary disease except well-controlled&#xD;
             asthma, or other condition that would preclude an OFC otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medication use that would interfere with an OFC result. Medications in this&#xD;
             category include antihistamines (first or second generation) within 1 week, omalizumab&#xD;
             within 3 months, and others listed in the protocol appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any skin condition aside from well-controlled eczema that might impact TEWL&#xD;
             measurement, including such conditions as autoimmune skin conditions (such as&#xD;
             psoriasis), congenital ichthyoses, hyper-IgE syndromes.&#xD;
