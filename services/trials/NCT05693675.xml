  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a clinical protocol&#xD;
      based on the administration of intraoperative intravenous methadone followed by a short&#xD;
      regimen of oral/IV (if the patient is not able to take oral) methadone following spine&#xD;
      surgery and to evaluate if methadone decreases persistent opioid usage at 3 months in&#xD;
      comparison to placebo.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive intraoperative methadone (0.2 mg/kg ideal body weight intravenously but not exceeding 20mg) followed by oral/IV methadone postoperatively according to the following scheme: A) Opioid naïve patients will receive 5mg twice daily dosage of methadone on postoperative days 1 and 2 followed by 5 mg daily on postoperative days 3, 4, and 5. B) Patients taking opioids preoperatively will continue to receive their regular opioids and additionally receive 5 mg twice a day of methadone on postoperative days 1 and 2, followed by 5 mg per day on days 3, 4 and 5.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive intraoperative methadone intravenously 0.2mg/kg followed by oral placebo postoperatively according to the following scheme: Opioid naïve patients and patients taking opioids preoperatively will receive placebo tablets twice daily on day 1 and day 2 and once daily day 3, 4 and 5. Patients taking preoperative opioids will be able to return to their baseline opioids immediately after surgery.</description>

All patients receive IV intravenous patient-controlled analgesia and rescue opioids which is usual care for postoperative pain.</description>
