  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine patient-reported outcomes after weight loss&#xD;
      surgery, including changes in health, mood, quality of life, health satisfaction, and&#xD;
      emotional health, in low-risk patients. Weight loss surgery has been well studied for&#xD;
      patients with body mass index (BMI) 35 kg/m^2 or more and those with weight-related medical&#xD;
      problems who have a BMI 30 kg/m^2 or more. However, outcomes after weight loss surgery in&#xD;
      patients with BMI under 35 kg/m^2 and without co-morbidities have not been well studied.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research is to determine patient-reported outcomes after weight loss&#xD;
      surgery in low-risk patients. Weight loss surgery has been well-studied for patients with&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) 35 kg/m^2 or more and those with weight-related medical problems who&#xD;
      have a BMI 30 kg/m^2 or more. Weight-related medical problems, also called co-morbidities,&#xD;
      can include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sleep apnea, and degenerative joint diseases.&#xD;
      The surgery is considered safe and effective. Outcomes after weight loss surgery in patients&#xD;
      with BMI under 35 kg/m^2 and without co-morbidities have not been well studied. The&#xD;
      investigators' purpose is to study patient-reported outcomes after weight loss surgery in&#xD;
      patients with BMI between 30 kg/m^2 and 34.5 kg/m^2 without co-morbidities. These include&#xD;
      changes in health, mood, quality of life, health satisfaction, and emotional health.&#xD;
