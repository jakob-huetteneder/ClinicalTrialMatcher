  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The implementation of therapeutic cooking workshops during the management of obesity in&#xD;
      hospitals is now well accepted and recognized as of potential interest on the nutritional&#xD;
      level but also cognitive and social (DESPORT, 2015; DAGONEAU, 2008). The literature shows&#xD;
      that adults participating in cooking workshops are satisfied and acquire cooking skills&#xD;
      potentially useful for improving their health (WOLFSON, BLEICH, 2015; CARAHER, 1999). REICKS&#xD;
      (2014, 2018) and REES (2012) point out, however, the low methodological quality of most of&#xD;
      the studies conducted and, in fact, the effectiveness of therapeutic cooking workshops has&#xD;
      not been formally demonstrated by rigorous randomized studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Care and Prevention Research Unit (CRESP) of the Manhès Hospital Center then built a&#xD;
      multicenter research protocol to demonstrate the impact of cooking workshops in the care of&#xD;
      patients with obesity. The protocol involves 6 hospitals: Georges Pompidou European Hospital&#xD;
      (HEGP) University Hospital Center (department of Prof S. CZERNICHOW), PITIE SALPETRIERE&#xD;
      University Hospital Center (department of Prof J.M. OPPERT), Cognacq Jay Hospital Center,&#xD;
      Forcilles Hospital Center, Bligny Hospital Center and Manhes Hospital Center .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CuisTO protocol was selected by the PHRIP Jury of the DGOS (General Direction of the Care&#xD;
      Offer French Ministry of Health) in 2019 as a high priority project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of remote cooking&#xD;
      workshops in the management of obesity, through two methods of setting up therapeutic cooking&#xD;
      workshops (so-called &quot;classic&quot; workshops and workshops in the form of &quot;culinary challenges&quot;)&#xD;
      to improve dietary balance in the context of the care of adult patients living with obesity.&#xD;
      Dietary balance will be estimated by compliance with the recommendations of the latest&#xD;
      National Health Nutrition Program (PNNS-4 2019-2023), &quot;judged&quot; by the PNNS-GS2 score, the&#xD;
      consumption of fruits and vegetables, the frequency of cooking and a reduction in the&#xD;
      consumption of ultra-processed dishes that have already been prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre, open-label, controlled, comparative intervention study with sequential&#xD;
      randomization in clusters (clusters) of the &quot;stepped wedge&quot; type&#xD;

These changes will be measured by the PNNS-GS2 score through a dietary survey and a frequency questionnaire (CHALTIEL et al, national health nutrition program&#xD;
- guidelines score 2 (PNNS-GS2): development and validation of a diet quality score reflecting the 2017 French dietary guidelines, British Journal of Nutrition, 2019, 122, 331-342)</description>

    <description>Achievement of the objectives set by the patient when he participates in a series of 6 cooking workshops such as &quot;I would like to learn to cook vegetables&quot; or &quot;cook less fat&quot;. The patient completes a questionnaire (before-after) proposing different possible objectives that the patients would like to achieve by participating in a cooking workshop. When filling out the questionnaire, the patient will have to choose the 3 objectives (out of 12 proposed + 1 free) which seem important to him when he attends a cooking workshop. He will have to number from 1 to 3 the order of importance of his objectives and note on a scale of 1 to 10 the skills he thinks he has in this area. The result is given in terms of the percentage of patients who have reached their initial personalized objective(s) after the two stages of the intervention. The achievement of the objectives set will be considered as achieved if the mark between the two interventions has increased.</description>
