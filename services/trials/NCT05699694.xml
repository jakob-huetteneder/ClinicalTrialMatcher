    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is defined as the progressive loss or deterioration of dopaminergic&#xD;
      neurons in Substantia Nigra (SN) of the brain. These cells normally produce dopamine which&#xD;
      acts like a messenger for normal muscular movement. Having less quantity of dopamine in the&#xD;
      synaptic cleft due to the loss of neural cells, symptoms become apparent. Neuroinflammation&#xD;
      and oxidative stress are involved. Treatment approaches to maintain the normal dopamine level&#xD;
      that include medication, surgery, cell therapy supplementation of L-Dihydroxyphenylalanine&#xD;
      (L-Dopa), a precursor of dopamine, in the form of Levodopa and/or Carbidopa, has been&#xD;
      available for PD therapy for 50 years. Stem cells constitute the repair system of the body.&#xD;
      Stem cells from bone marrow can be mobilized according to the need of repair of the tissue.&#xD;
      Suggested use of the food supplement actually sold in the USA and Europe: Take two capsules,&#xD;
      1 to 3 times per day with a glass of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All raw materials are food grade. All extracts are water or ethanolic extracts, which are&#xD;
      authorized solvents for dietary supplements in the USA and EU. All ingredients are compliant&#xD;
      with US and EU contaminants regulation (microbiological profile, heavy metals, pesticides)&#xD;
      especially EU pharmacopeia, the product shows to increase Stem Cell circulation in peripheral&#xD;
      blood.&#xD;
