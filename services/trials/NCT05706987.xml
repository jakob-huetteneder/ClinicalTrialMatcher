      1.Written informed consent must be obtained before any study specific procedures are&#xD;
      undertaken.Qualified participants were identified at the pre-anesthesia evaluation clinic or&#xD;
      ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.80 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of I-II in our medical&#xD;
      center scheduled to undergo elective surgery for hypertrophy of labia minor with MAC.&#xD;
      Patients were randomized 1:1 into the Group 1 (normal saline) or Group 2 (lidocaine 1.5&#xD;
      mg/kg/hr, ideal body weight) by using a table of random, computer-generated digits in sealed&#xD;
      and numbered envelopes by an anesthesiologist. All surgical procedure was performed by the&#xD;
      same surgeon and the anesthetic data was recorded by a nurse anesthetist. All patients were&#xD;
      fasted overnight before the procedure, and no medications were allowed before induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. Standard monitoring, such as non-invasive arterial blood pressure,&#xD;
      electrocardiography (lead II), pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (EtCO2) was&#xD;
      applied for each patient. Participants were pre-oxygenated and adequately maintained with&#xD;
      100% oxygen at 3 L/min via a nasal cannula during the entire procedure. During anesthesia&#xD;
      induction, all patients received intravenous fentanyl 0.5-1 mcg/kg, continuous infusion of&#xD;
      propofol with target-controlled infusion (TCI; Fresenius Orchestra Primea; Fresenius Kabi AG,&#xD;
      Bad Homburg, Germany) with the Ce of 4.0 mcg/mL and parecoxib. In addition, continuous&#xD;
      infusion of equal volume normal saline and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg/hr (ideal body weight) in&#xD;
      group I and 2, respectively. In all patients, maintenance of the Ce of propofol was adjusted&#xD;
      upward or downward by 0.5 mcg/mL to keep patient adequate sedation with acceptable pain&#xD;
      (remaining moveless). If upward 2 times of propofol and the patient still move which affect&#xD;
      the surgical procedure, fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg was prescribed, and mean arterial pressure (MAP)&#xD;
      and heart rate (HR) within baseline levels. As soon as the last suture, the propofol and&#xD;
      lidocaine were discontinued. After the procedure, all patients were sent to the PACU for&#xD;
      further care under clear consciousness.&#xD;

      Patients were monitored for MBP, HR, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate&#xD;
      (RR), EtCO2, Ce of propofol, BIS values, OAA/S at the T1: before anesthesia induction, T2:&#xD;
      time of the skin incision, T3: 15 minutes after the skin incision, T4: 30 minutes after the&#xD;
      skin incision, T5: 45 minutes after the skin incision, T6: time of the beginning skin suture,&#xD;
      and T7: time of the end of procedure. Collected data also include the time that the surgery&#xD;
      ended, the total usage of propofol and fentanyl, the frequency to adjustment of TCI, times of&#xD;
      patient move affect the procedure, and the surgeon's satisfaction. At PACU, patients were&#xD;
      monitored for HR, MBP, SpO2, RR, NRS, RASS, length of stay, PONV and patient satisfaction&#xD;
      (scoring 1-5).&#xD;
