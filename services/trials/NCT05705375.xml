  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will generate novel evidence regarding the effect of waterpipe size on smoking&#xD;
      behavior, toxicant exposures and subjective experiences among waterpipe smokers. Findings&#xD;
      from this project will help the FDA in developing waterpipe size-specific regulations to curb&#xD;
      waterpipe smoking in the US and protect public health.&#xD;
