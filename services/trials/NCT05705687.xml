  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicenter, non-randomized research program that includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a phase IV study (for all patients) with a collection of tissue specimens of tumor,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a phase II study (for patients with primary mediastinal tumors and an unfavorable&#xD;
           decline in tumor markers),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and a diagnostic study (for all patients, except patients with brain metastases at&#xD;
           baseline or patients for whom any brain MRI is contra-indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question it aims to answer is improving outcome for young adults with poor-prognosis&#xD;
      Non Seminomatous Germ Cell Tumor (NSGCT) is to validate prospectively the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of a personalized treatment based on early tumor marker kinetic assessment in real life for&#xD;
      patients with poor-prognosis NSGCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed-up according to the assessment of decline kinetics of the tumor&#xD;
      markers at the end of a first chemotherapy cycle and according to the localisation of the&#xD;
      primary lesion if unfavorable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the case of a patient with a favorable decline of the tumor markers, he will be&#xD;
           treated by 3 additional standard chemotherapy cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the case of a patient with a testicular or peritoneal primary tumor and an&#xD;
           unfavorable decline of the tumor markers, the patient will be treated by a dose-dense&#xD;
           standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient with a mediastinal primary tumor and an unfavorable decline of the tumor&#xD;
           markers will be proposed to enter the phase II part of the study or to enter the&#xD;
           dose-dense regimen like the other primary localisations. If the patient consents and is&#xD;
           eligible for phase II part, he will undergo either an early surgery if feasible or a&#xD;
           high-dose chemotherapy if the early surgery is not possible.&#xD;
