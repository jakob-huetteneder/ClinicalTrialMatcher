      The goal of this clinical trial is to test whether changes in lactate kinetics during&#xD;
      exercise (due to glycogen depletion or hyperthermia) alter the pattern of fat oxidation&#xD;
      during a maximal incremental cycle ergometer test in healthy young active people. The main&#xD;
      questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will a rightward shift in lactate kinetics, induced by a previous glycogen depletion,&#xD;
           produce a rightward shift in fat oxidation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will a leftward shift in lactate kinetics due to an increase in ambient temperature&#xD;
           produce a leftward shift in fat oxidation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform three maximal incremental tests in three different conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  one in the control condition;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  one with glycogen depletion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and one with ambient heat (the latter two in randomized, counterbalanced order).&#xD;

      Introduction Lactate has three major functions: it is an energy substrate, it is a&#xD;
      gluconeogenic precursor, and it is a signalling molecule (1). Among the signalling functions&#xD;
      is that of modulating skeletal muscle metabolism, as a regulator of fat oxidation at both the&#xD;
      autocrine and paracrine levels. At the autocrine level, lactate increases the levels of&#xD;
      Acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) inside the mitochondria and, consequently, the levels of Malonyl-CoA.&#xD;
      The increase in Malonyl-CoA concentration inhibits Carnitine PalmitoylTransferase 1 (CPT1),&#xD;
      which is one of the transporters of fatty acids into the mitochondria (2). At the paracrine&#xD;
      level, an increase in blood lactate concentration reduces the release of fatty acids into the&#xD;
      blood by adipose tissue (3). This occurs because the G protein-coupled receptor present in&#xD;
      adipose tissue inhibits the release of fatty acids into the blood when the blood lactate&#xD;
      concentration increases (4). However, in vivo, only an inverse correlation between blood&#xD;
      lactate concentration and fatty acid oxidation has been demonstrated (5,6). Therefore, the&#xD;
      main objective of the study is to observe whether the pattern of fat oxidation during a&#xD;
      maximal incremental cycle ergometer trial is altered due to changes in lactate kinetics&#xD;
      during the given trial. For this purpose, three maximal trials will be performed with the&#xD;
      same loading protocol (intensity and progression of the same), but different physiological&#xD;
      conditions (normal vs. previous glycogen depletion vs. environmental hyperthermia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Consent to participate (signature of informed consent) will be requested from all&#xD;
      volunteers who meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tests that will be performed throughout this study will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the first appointment, you will be asked about your medical history. Then, if&#xD;
           appropriate, an assessment of your body composition by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)&#xD;
           will be performed,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the second appointment, spirometry, an electrocardiogram at rest, and finally, an&#xD;
           ergospirometric trial will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In the third, fourth, and fifth visits, three maximal exercise trials will be performed,&#xD;
           one each day. Of the three maximum ergospirometric trials that will be performed, one&#xD;
           will be in a hot environment -approximately 38ยบ Celsius (ยบC) ambient temperature- and&#xD;
           the other in a state of glycogen depletion. A glycogen depletion protocol and a&#xD;
           low-carbohydrate diet will be performed before the maximal ergospirometric trial in the&#xD;
           glycogen-depleted state, while the other two trials (simple maximal trial and&#xD;
           hot-environment maximal trial) will be performed after 24h of a high-carbohydrate diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The order of performance of each protocol will be randomized, provided that the glycogen&#xD;
           depletion protocol is performed at the visit prior to the maximal ergospirometric trial&#xD;
           under glycogen depletion. The depletion protocol consists of a 60-minute continuous&#xD;
           cycle ergometer effort at the power associated with 60% of the maximal oxygen uptake&#xD;
           (VO2) followed by six 30-second maximal efforts with four minutes of recovery. After&#xD;
           this glycogen depletion exercise protocol, the participant will follow a&#xD;
           low-carbohydrate diet (2% carbohydrate, 78% fat, and 20% protein), until the time of the&#xD;
           ergospirometric trial under glycogen depletion status.&#xD;
