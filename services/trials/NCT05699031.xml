  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the rehabilitation by use of a smartphone-app&#xD;
      with the usual care of physical therapy in patients, 60 years and older, who underwent a&#xD;
      primary shoulder arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is the outcome of rehabilitation with the app as good as the usual care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is the outcome for both types of shoulder arthroplasty similar?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what is the usability of the app?.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have treatment according to the group they are allocated to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fill in questionnaires at specific moments during the rehabilitation stage (0 - 3 months&#xD;
           ) and at 1 year post-surgery&#xD;
