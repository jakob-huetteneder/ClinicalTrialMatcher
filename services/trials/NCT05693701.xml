  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose and objective of this study is to improve cholesterol treatment among blood&#xD;
      donors with FH (Familial Hypercholesterolemia).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center randomized, two arm trial. The two study arms include usual care&#xD;
      (standard notification) and implementation bundle intervention. UT Southwestern Medical&#xD;
      Center will be the main study site and Carter Blood Care will serve as the recruitment site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/Baseline visit: Donors agreeing to participate in the study will be informed of&#xD;
      study procedures and will provide informed consent. A 20 mL blood sample as well as a urine&#xD;
      sample will be obtained for eligibility screening laboratories and baseline LDL-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up phone call: At 3 months post-randomization, participants in both arms will be&#xD;
      briefly contacted by phone by the Research Assistant to thank them for their participation&#xD;
      and to answer any study related questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study 6 month visit. Participants will engage in a virtual visit for end of study&#xD;
      procedures. At this follow-up visit, the Research Assistant will assess for any adverse&#xD;
      events and direct the participant to collect a fasting blood sample for repeat LDL-C&#xD;
      measurement. The Research Assistant will administer an electronic survey and knowledge&#xD;
      questionnaires. Additional clinical visits as desired by the participants' physicians will be&#xD;
      allowed at their discretion.&#xD;
