  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to test a wrist-worn nerve stimulator in adolescents with&#xD;
      chronic migraine/headache and mood disturbance. The main question it aims to answer is&#xD;
      whether this device is effective in relieving clinical symptoms including pain, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression and sleep disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear the device for twelve weeks and complete monthly surveys throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Apollo Neuro Device on&#xD;
      remediating clinical and physical symptoms of adolescents struggling with chronic&#xD;
      migraine/headache with overlapping mood disturbance. This device is worn on the wrist and&#xD;
      produces silent, low-frequency waves that feel like slight vibrations. An Apollo Neuro Device&#xD;
      will be offered as part of a treatment plan to patients with chronic neurological symptoms.&#xD;
      Patients will be placed in either a treatment or waitlist treatment group randomly. Those in&#xD;
      the treatment group will immediately use the Apollo Neuro Device for twelve weeks and those&#xD;
      in the waitlist group will follow the standard plan of care for twelve weeks. At twelve weeks&#xD;
      the initial treatment group will conclude their time in the study and the waitlist group will&#xD;
      begin use of the device for another twelve weeks. Patients will complete surveys when they&#xD;
      are given the Apollo Neuro Device, monthly while using the device, and after twelve weeks of&#xD;
      use. The waitlist group will also complete surveys upon enrolling in the study and monthly&#xD;
      thereafter until the completion of their intervention. The findings of this study will&#xD;
      further the understanding of autonomic dysfunction symptomology and recovery in the diagnosis&#xD;
      of adolescent chronic headache/migraine and evaluate the effect of nerve stimulation as a&#xD;
      means of mediating autonomic nervous system dysfunction and reducing symptoms in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
