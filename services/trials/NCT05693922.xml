      Investigating whether delta-beta cross-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation&#xD;
      can augment the effects of a single session of behavioral activation in participants with&#xD;
      major depressive disorder.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether concurrent transcranial alternating current&#xD;
      stimulation (tACS) augments the effects of a single session behavioral activation (BA)&#xD;
      treatment of depression. Following a series of clinical assessments, participants will&#xD;
      perform a reward-based decision-making task while electroencephalography (EEG) is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, all participants will take part in a single-session 90-minute BA intervention; half of&#xD;
      the participants will receive delta-beta tACS during the final 30 minutes of the session and&#xD;
      half will receive an active sham stimulation. Participants will return two weeks later for&#xD;
      another task-based EEG. Four weeks after the intervention session, they will receive&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires via email to complete online.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will take part in a single-session behavioral activation (BA) intervention. To examine the effects of neurostimulation on treatment response, participants will be randomized to receive either delta-beta cross-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) or an active sham.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This study is designed to be double-blind. This means that the participant and the researchers are unaware of each participant's assignment until the completion of all data collection. This is accomplished using the randomization codes described above. Furthermore, this study utilizes an active sham stimulation. The active sham condition includes brief stimulation, mimicking the skin sensations associated with tACS. In our previously concluded trial, participants in the delta-beta tACS and active sham groups responded similarly to the blinding questionnaire, indicating that our active sham stimulation successfully blinded the participants.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in clinician-rated depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to follow-up 2 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment response will be calculated as the change in clinician rated depression symptom scores using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Items are scaled either from 0 - 2 to 0 - 4, and each item is summed for a total score. Benchmarks suggested at: 0-7 normal; 8 - 13 mild depression; 14-18 moderate depression; 19-22 severe depression; &gt;=23 very severe depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in phase-amplitude coupling between delta-beta oscillations during task performance of the Streamlined Expenditure of Effort for Reward Task (S-EEfRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to follow-up 2 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>In the Streamlined Expenditure of Effort for Reward Task (S-EEfRT), participants choose to complete a HARD task requiring many button presses or an EASY task with fewer button presses for variable monetary incentives. Number of button presses is individualized for each participant.&#xD;
Delta-beta coupling during the HARD/EASY decision will be calculated between the phase of delta oscillations (2-3Hz) in prefrontal electrodes (FCz and surrounding electrodes) and the amplitude of beta oscillations (15-25Hz) in left motor electrodes (C3 and surrounding electrodes). The instantaneous phase and amplitude of these oscillations will be calculated by averaging the signal in these two regions, band-filtering the signal to the specified range, and then performing the Hilbert transform on the signal. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is calculated by creating a hybrid signal using the beta oscillation amplitude in left motor electrodes and the delta oscillation phase in prefrontal electrodes.</description>

    <description>The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale-Clinician (SHAPS-C) is a clinician administered tool to assess symptoms of anhedonia. The SHAPS-C items use a Likert scale of 1-4, with higher scores reflecting greater pathology.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a single session intervention of behavioral activation (BA) psychotherapy. Stimulation will be delivered via the NeuroConn DC-STIMULATOR MC at 1 milliampere (mA) zero-to-peak amplitude at the target electrodes and 2 mA zero to-peak amplitude at the return electrode. The tACS will be delivered using the cross-frequency stimulation waveform delta-beta (3-20Hz).</description>
