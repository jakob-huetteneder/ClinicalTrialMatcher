      This pilot study will be a prospective, single arm study to investigate the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of a brief, telehealth, cognitive compensatory training intervention for&#xD;
      children with a history of pediatric cancer at the University of Michigan. Study aims to&#xD;
      enroll 10 children with a history of treatment for pediatric cancer, along with their&#xD;
      caregiver.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient is at least 6 months posttreatment completion&#xD;

             by either (a) performance below one standard deviation on at least one cognitive&#xD;
             measure of attention or executive functioning, such as on the Conners Continuous&#xD;
             Performance Test (CPT-3), Trail making Test A &amp; B, Children's Category Test (CCT), and&#xD;
             Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and/or (b) executive functioning and attention&#xD;
             problems are identified during screening with the research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
