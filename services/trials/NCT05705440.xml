  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this follow-up study is to describe the safety in subsequent pregnancies in&#xD;
      participants who were previously administered the RSVPreF3 maternal vaccine or control during&#xD;
      any previous RSV MAT primary study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants enrolled in this follow-up study received RSVPreF3 maternal&#xD;
      vaccination (any dose) or controls during the following RSV MAT primary studies: RSV MAT-001&#xD;
      (NCT03674177), RSV MAT-004 (NCT04126213), RSV MAT-010 (NCT05045144), RSV MAT-011&#xD;
      (NCT04138056), RSV MAT-009 (NCT04605159), RSV MAT-012 (NCT04980391) and RSV MAT-039&#xD;
      (NCT05169905).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No intervention will be administered in this study. The exposure was the intervention (either&#xD;
      RSVPreF3 vaccine or control) received by the study participants in the above-mentioned&#xD;
      previous RSV MAT studies.&#xD;
