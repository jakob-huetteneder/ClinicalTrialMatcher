      This is a phase II study to investigate the safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo parallel controlled, 2 cohorts phase II&#xD;
      study will contain 2 cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: diabetic kidney disease Cohort 2: biopsy-proven IgAN In each cohort, approximately&#xD;
      120 patients will be randomized to receive SC0062 or placebo daily for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of SC0062&#xD;
      capsules compared to placebo in patients with chronic kidney disease (diabetic kidney disease&#xD;
      and IgA nephropathy) with albuminuria who are treated with the maximum tolerated labeled dose&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi).&#xD;
