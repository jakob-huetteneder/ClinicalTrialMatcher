  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical study is to compare the effects of tDCS, physiotherapy, and their&#xD;
      association with the intensity and frequency of pain in women with Chronic Migraine. For this&#xD;
      purpose, the patients included in the study will be distributed among four groups following a&#xD;
      factorial model.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A factorial, randomized clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate pain control, the number&#xD;
      of migraine attacks, quality of life, emotional dysfunctions, and attentional processing of&#xD;
      migraine patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes will be evaluated through (I) a Visual Analog Scale (VAS); (II) a headache&#xD;
      diary; (III) a Headache Impact Test (HIT-6); (IV) a Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS);&#xD;
      (V) Short-Form Health Survey Questionnaire de 36 items (SF-36); (VI) Patients' Global&#xD;
      Impression of Change Scale (PGICS); (VII) Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); (VIII) State-Trait&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory (S-TAI); (IX) Perceived Stress Scale (PSS); and (X) Facial Expression&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline; after 1 month; after 3 month;</time_frame>
    <description>This scale will be used to measure the patients' pain intensity. The scale consists of a 100 mm line within the limits of no pain and worst possible pain. The patient is instructed to trace the intensity of his pain within the limits of the line. Changes of 1.1 to 1.2 cm indicate minimal clinical improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline; after 1 month; after 3 month;</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument assesses the participants' anxiety. It consists of 40 statements that consider trait anxiety and state anxiety. Answers are given on a four-point Likert-type scale (1 - not to 4 - very much), and the score can vary between 20-80. Anxiety level classification can be low (20-33 points), medium (33-49 points), and high (49-80 points).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; after 1 month; after 3 month;</time_frame>
    <description>It is an instrument composed of 14 questions with response options ranging from zero to four (0=never; 1=almost never; 2=sometimes; 3=almost always, and 4=always). Questions with a positive connotation (4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 13) have their scores inverted: 0=4, 1=3, 2=2, 3=1, and 4=0. The other questions have negative valence and are added directly. The score is the sum of the scores for each question and can range from 0 to 56.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Facial Expression Database</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; after 1 month; after 3 month;</time_frame>
    <description>This is an instrument that evaluates the recognition of facial expressions. The bank of faces from Lacop - Facial Expression Database will be used with expressions of joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and surprise from two male and two female models. The manipulation of the intensity of the expressions will be carried out through the Morpheus 4.0 Software to generate faces with different emotional intensities with incremental advances of 25% from the neutral face until reaching 100% of expression intensity.</description>
