      EYE-FIT is a randomized clinical trial with a two-arm parallel design aimed at assessing the&#xD;
      impact of performing a structured and supervised physical training program on the different&#xD;
      variables associated with glaucoma progression in pharmacologically treated primary open&#xD;
      angle glaucoma patients. This intervention will include a supervised 24-weeks concurrent&#xD;
      (endurance + resistance) training program comparing its influence to the standard care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are claims that more physically active individuals are less likely to glaucoma onset&#xD;
      and progression. However, to date, there is not a single randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      assessing the impact of performing a structured and supervised physical training program on&#xD;
      glaucoma progression. A randomized controlled clinical trial with a two-arm parallel design&#xD;
      will be used to determine the chronic effects of a 24-weeks concurrent (endurance +&#xD;
      resistance) training program in comparison to a control group (no training prescribed) on the&#xD;
      ocular function and physical fitness of primary open angle glaucoma patients. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly divided in one of the two groups (experimental or control [wait-list]),&#xD;
      while ocular function and physical fitness will be assessed before and after the intervention&#xD;
      by researchers blinded to the group allocation of each participant. In addition, primary open&#xD;
      angle glaucoma patients will be subdivided according to their medical treatment in two groups&#xD;
      (prostaglandin analogues and combination of prostaglandin analogue and beta-blockers).&#xD;
      Therefore, four groups will be considered in this clinical trial. The results of the EYE-FIT&#xD;
      clinical trial will provide novel information on the influence of exercise on different&#xD;
      markers of glaucoma, and may help to reduce the clinical, economic and social burden of this&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
