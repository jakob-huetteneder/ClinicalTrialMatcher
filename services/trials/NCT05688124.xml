      This is a randomized, open-label, two-cycle clinical study to evaluate the drug interaction,&#xD;
      food effect and pharmacokinetics of IBI351 and esomeprazole in healthy subjects. A total of&#xD;
      two cohorts were planned to be enrolled in each cohort. Cohort 1: This cohort investigated&#xD;
      the effect of esomeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of IBI351 in healthy subjects. Cohort 2:&#xD;
      This cohort investigated the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of IBI351 in healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

    <description>This cohort investigated the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of IBI351 in healthy subjects. In a double-crossover design, subjects were enrolled and randomly divided into two test groups A and B. Group A: IBI351 was orally administered to subjects in this group on an empty stomach on Day 1, followed by a high-fat meal on Day 4. Group B: IBI351 was orally administered to subjects in this group after a high-fat meal on Day 1 followed by an empty stomach on Day 4.</description>
