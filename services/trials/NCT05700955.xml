      The primary purpose of this study is to test the safety of Pembrolizumab and Temozolomide in&#xD;
      treating recurrent glioblastoma and to characterize the effect of this treatment on the&#xD;

      Participants will undergo screening tests to determine if they are eligible to participate.&#xD;
      This will involve a complete history and physical examination, vital signs, blood tests&#xD;
      including complete blood count (CBC), and serum chemistry (CMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive one cycle of Temozolomide and Pembrolizumab prior to removing&#xD;
      recurrent tumor, followed by three weekly cycles of treatment until progression.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The experience with neoadjuvant immunotherapy has raised the possibility of utilizing surgical resection/immunotherapy as a combination treatment for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. There are several reasons that suggest that surgical resection will likely enhance the activity of immunotherapy in glioblastoma.This includes 1) direct impact on tumor cells; 2) impact on immune cells; and 3) impact on immune infiltration. The combination of the evidence that neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab has a positive effect on GBM survival, the evidence in lung cancer that chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor therapies are synergistic and the clinical utility of surgery in patients with recurrent glioblastoma has suggested that the neoadjuvant administration of Pembrolizumab and temozolomide prior to and following maximal surgical resection represents a very attractive experimental combination for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants will take Temozolomide pills at home at a dose determined by body weight. They will take the pills for five days every 3 weeks. It will be dispensed by the pharmacy and must be stored in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light and kept from freezing. It will be kept out of the reach of children. Outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed will be returned to the Brown Cancer Center pharmacy for disposal.</description>

    <description>Pembrolizumab will be administered at a dose of 200 mg as an IV infusion through a freely flowing IV. The diluted solution will be administered intravenously over 30 minutes through an intravenous line containing a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding 0.2 micron to 5 micron in-line or add-on filter. Other drugs will not be co-administered through the same infusion line. Pembrolizumab doses will be repeated every three weeks.</description>
