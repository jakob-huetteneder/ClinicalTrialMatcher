  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomized to receive either paracetamol during mechanical ventilation. When&#xD;
      patients were randomized to receive paracetamol (40 mg/kg per day in 4 doses), a placebo&#xD;
      infusion of normal saline was administered continuously at the same rate as an equivalent&#xD;
      infusion. Placebos could not be distinguished from the active study drug in color, odor, or&#xD;
      viscosity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both study groups, IMV was maintained with sufentanil (0-0.2 mcg/kg/h), propofol (0-4&#xD;
      mg/kg/h), and dexmedetomidine (0-1 mcg/kg/h). Assessment of sedation levels by the bedside&#xD;
      nurse using the FLACC pain scale to determine if the child is adequately comfortable or in&#xD;
      need of more or less medication to maintain adequate ventilation. Assessment of sedation&#xD;
      levels by the bedside nurse using the FLACC pain scale (every 6 hours as a minimum time&#xD;
      interval).&#xD;
