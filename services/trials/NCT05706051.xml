  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presbycusis could be associated to increased risk to fall. There is little about the impact&#xD;
      on postural balance of hearing aids. In this study, the investigators describe the postural&#xD;
      balance evolution before and after hearing aid fitting in presbycusis-affected adults&#xD;
      (55-80years old) consulting Angers University Hospital ENT department and ENT Medical Doctor&#xD;
      of Le Mans .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      After being informed about te study and consentment, patients meeting inclusion criteria&#xD;
      consulting for presbycusis and in indication for hearing aids will be included to have&#xD;
      posturometry (V0). Posturometry is performed 3 months later, before the first hearing aid&#xD;
      installation (V1a) and after (V1b), as well as three months after hearing aid wearing (V2).&#xD;
      Evolution of posturometry parameters without hearing aids between V0 and V1a serve as control&#xD;
      and is compared to the evolution of posturometry parameters after hearing aid wearing between&#xD;
      V1b and V2.&#xD;
