  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is defined as skin inflammation resulting from&#xD;
      prolonged exposure to feces and/or urine, found in individuals with urinary incontinence,&#xD;
      fecal incontinence, or both. Currently, preventive and treatment measures with strong&#xD;
      clinical evidence include gentle hygiene and application of barrier products. Justification:&#xD;
      Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) is used in the tissue repair process, due to its analgesic,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and biomodulator effects, with improvement in the treatment of pressure&#xD;
      injuries. In this way, would the use of LLLT bring better results associated with topical&#xD;
      treatment for the management of IAD?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a field study, analytical, interventionist, controlled clinical trial type,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind and with quantitative data analysis, with the aim of comparing the&#xD;
      topical treatment of Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis in the elderly with the topical&#xD;
      treatment associated with Low Intensity Laser Therapy. The study population will consist of&#xD;
      elderly people with Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis admitted to a surgical and&#xD;
      semi-intensive medical clinic of a private, tertiary, extra-sized hospital, located in the&#xD;
      south zone of the city of SÃ£o Paulo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be divided initially by the characteristics of IAD: persistent erythema&#xD;
      with intact epidermis and erythema with signs of epidermis loss. Subsequently, randomization&#xD;
      will be performed using the REDCap platform and participants will be divided into Control&#xD;
      Group and Experimental Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control Group will receive the conventional treatment and the Experimental Group will&#xD;
      receive the conventional treatment associated with the application of Low Intensity Laser&#xD;
      Therapy. The conventional treatment of patients belonging to both groups will be made&#xD;
      available in the institutional protocol of the study site for the treatment of&#xD;
      Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis, according to its characteristics of persistent erythema&#xD;
      with intact epidermis or erythema with signs of epidermis loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent erythema with intact epidermis: Perform intimate hygiene with warm water (to&#xD;
      remove excess feces and urine), apply skin cleanser without rinsing to finish cleaning, apply&#xD;
      a thin layer of Dexpanthenol (with each diaper change), apply polymeric solution spray once a&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythema with signs of epidermis loss: Perform intimate hygiene with warm water (to remove&#xD;
      excess feces and urine), apply a leave-in skin cleanser to finish cleaning, apply powdered&#xD;
      hydrocolloid powder and remove excess. Afterwards, apply a polymeric spray solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the application of LLLT, laser therapy equipment will be used with a wavelength of 660nm&#xD;
      and 808nm, power of 100mW, with category 3R and within the institution's calibration&#xD;
      period.The entire area affected by DAI will be irradiated with LBI at 1 Joule (J) of energy&#xD;
      and with a wavelength of 660nm and 1J with a wavelength of 808nm, which will be applied&#xD;
      simultaneously, with a radiance of 20J/cm2 per point, the distance between the stitches will&#xD;
      be 1cm long and the application of LLLT will be performed every 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be followed up with daily visits for four days, starting from the&#xD;
      beginning of the proposed treatment, and follow-up may end before the end of the four-day&#xD;
      period, in the following cases: if the IAD is resolved, if the participant is discharged from&#xD;
      the hospital , if the participant is transferred to intensive care or oncology during the&#xD;
      study period, if the nursing team changes the conduct of the proposed treatment, if the&#xD;
      physician changes the proposed treatment or if the participant refuses to remain in the study&#xD;
      or the participant is diagnosed with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored for four days. Both groups will receive topical treatment&#xD;
      according to the characteristics of the DAI and participants in the Experimental Group will&#xD;
      receive low-level laser therapy for three days. On the first and fourth day of follow-up, a&#xD;
      photographic record of the area affected by IAD will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first and fourth day of follow-up, it will be evaluated whether the participant has&#xD;
      pain in the region affected by IAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the first and last day of treatment will be carried out through the answers&#xD;
      of the pain evaluation by the verbal and numerical scale or PANAID to verify if there was&#xD;
      improvement or not of the pain in the area affected by the IAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three expert judges, with more than five years of experience in stomatherapy, will evaluate&#xD;
      the photographic record of the first and last day of treatment. The photographic records will&#xD;
      be made available through the REDCap platform and the evaluators will not know which&#xD;
      treatment was proposed to the participants and will not know about the evaluation of the&#xD;
      other evaluator. A Likert scale from 0 to 10 (0=no improvement and 10= complete improvement)&#xD;
      will be used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed treatment.&#xD;
