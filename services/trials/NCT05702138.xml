  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore whether the types and intensity of the interventions being delivered&#xD;
      will yield measurable cognitive benefits in addition to improved mobility and balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study evaluates three therapeutic approaches to improve mobility and balance after&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (TBI): Conventional Gait and Balance Training, high intensity step&#xD;
      training, and high intensity step training with virtual reality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) walk more slowly, demonstrate greater&#xD;
      imbalance, and have reduced endurance. There is strong evidence that a single bout of&#xD;
      physical activity has substantial cognitive benefits among older adults and stroke survivors,&#xD;
      yet similar studies have not been conducted in TBI. This study will explore whether the types&#xD;
      and intensity of the interventions being delivered will yield measurable cognitive benefits&#xD;
      in addition to improved mobility and balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study evaluates three therapeutic approaches to improve mobility and balance after TBI:&#xD;
      the first approach, Conventional Gait and Balance Training (CGBT), represents the current&#xD;
      approach for walking retraining. CGBT focuses on walking training in a variety of conditions,&#xD;
      obstacle management training, functional independence training, strength training, and&#xD;
      standing dynamic balance training. The second approach, high intensity step training (HIST),&#xD;
      focuses on the repetition of stepping at higher cardiovascular intensities and yielding a&#xD;
      greater number of steps per training session with promising evidence already published in&#xD;
      stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI). The third approach combines virtual reality with HIST,&#xD;
      designed to increase cortical excitability while concurrently activating the neuromuscular&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
