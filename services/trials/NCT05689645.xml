  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled PhaseⅡ clinical trial .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study was to confirm the efficacy and safety of F573 for injection&#xD;
      in the treatment of liver injury/failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, the study was divided into two&#xD;
      phases according to the subjects' risk of liver failure due to liver injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage: The 36 patients with 1/2 grade DILI and 12 patients with CHB were&#xD;
      enrolled,Firstly, DILI patients were treated with trial drug 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mg/kg or placebo&#xD;
      in a 1:1:1:1 ratio,CHB patients received the trial drug or placebo in a 3:1 ratio, and the&#xD;
      dose was determined based on the efficacy and safety results of the DILI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second stage:The 2/3 grade DILI patients and CHB patients were enrolled, 12 cases in each&#xD;
      group, and they were assigned to the experimental group and the control group in a ratio of&#xD;
      3:1.the drug dose given was determined by the combination of efficacy and safety results in&#xD;
      the first stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was divided into screening period (14 days), treatment period (14 days) and&#xD;
      follow-up period (28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening eligible subjects received the trial drug or placebo in a 3:1 ratio once daily for&#xD;
      14 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DILI subjects and CHB subjects should also use Diammonium glycyrrhizate enteric-coated&#xD;
      capsules for basic treatment.After withdrawal, the subjects were followed up for 28 days for&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining subject consent, pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected for CHB&#xD;
      patients in stages 1 and 2 in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Third stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. The study was divided&#xD;
      into screening period (14 days), treatment period (28 days) and follow-up period (90 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      48 screen eligible subjects received trial drug or placebo in a ratio of 3:1, once a day for&#xD;
      28 days. The dose was determined according to the results of the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      first and second stages. Subjects should also receive concurrent drug acetylcysteine&#xD;
      injection (NAC). After withdrawal, the subjects were followed up for 90 days for safety.&#xD;
