    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to determine the Effects of facilitatory Kinesio-taping and&#xD;
      concentric quadriceps strengthening on gait parameters in knee osteoarthritis. Randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials will be done at Physio Experts Clinic, Islamabad. The sample size is 38. The&#xD;
      subjects were divided in two groups, with 19 subjects in Group A and 19 in Group B. Study&#xD;
      duration was of 6 months. Sampling technique applied was Non probability Convenience Sampling&#xD;
      technique. Both males and females of aged 50-60 years with Knee OA grade 2 or 3 were&#xD;
      included. Tools used in the study are Numeric Pain Rating Score (NPRS), dynamometer, WOMAC&#xD;
      questionnaire and Mobile app for measuring Temporospatial gait parameters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders in adults. It is a&#xD;
      degenerative joint disease affecting 15%-40% of people more than 40 years of age. The term&#xD;
      osteoarthritis was authored in 1886 by the English doctor, John Kent Spender. Clinical&#xD;
      assessment to recognize OA from RA and other comparable conditions turned out to be broadly&#xD;
      acknowledged by the main decade of the twentieth century enormous because of the endeavors&#xD;
      set forward by Archibald E.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint condition that causes other joint tissues to lose&#xD;
      gross cartilage and to experience morphological damage. Pathological changes seen in knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis joints include progressive loss and destruction of articular cartilage,&#xD;
      thickening of the subchondral bone, formation of osteophytes, variable degrees of&#xD;
      inflammation of the synovium, degeneration of ligaments and menisci of the knee and&#xD;
      hypertrophy of the joint capsule. Biomechanical factor that is assumed to contribute to the&#xD;
      etiology of OA is laxity of knee joint, which is described as the rotation or displacement of&#xD;
      femur from tibia. One research found that Varus-valgus laxity in patients with unaltered&#xD;
      knees and unilateral OA is wider than in stable healthy participants, indicating knee joint&#xD;
      laxity may be disease predisposing. the progress of the lateral and medial knee OA, as&#xD;
      defined by narrowing of joint space and a degradation of physical activity, was found to have&#xD;
      been linked with lower limb valgus-Varus alignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main focus in OA management is on promoting self-management, reducing pain, optimize&#xD;
      function, and modifying the disease process and its effects. The primary treatment for OA&#xD;
      knee conservatively is physiotherapy which includes strength training, modalities, knee&#xD;
      bracing, resistance training and Kinesiotaping. Resistance exercise can reduce knee pain&#xD;
      severity and leg strength in participants with symptomatic knee OA. Exercise interventions&#xD;
      using free weights or machines have generally focused on movements with concentric muscle&#xD;
      contractions. Previous interventions were developed based on loads lifted during the&#xD;
      concentric phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinesiotape (KT), is an elastic woven-cotton strip with a heat- sensitive acrylic adhesive&#xD;
      structure.&#xD;

    <description>Kinesiotaping is applied on the anterior thigh (quadriceps) region starting at 1/5 of the distance between anterosuperior iliac spine (ASIS) and tibia tuberosity. The tape is applied with 20% tension of the tape. The tape was tensioned from proximal region of mid quadriceps down to tibia tuberosity and, once it reached the knee, the tape was divided in the middle allowing it to circle the joint</description>
