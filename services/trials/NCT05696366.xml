      This is a single site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to quantify the&#xD;
      effects of combination adjunctive therapy on glycemic control, ketogenesis during&#xD;
      insulinopenia, insulin resistance, and diabetes burden and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 22 adult participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D) will be enrolled with at least 16&#xD;
      participants completing the study in full. After screening, baseline data (A1c, CGM,&#xD;
      ambulatory insulin dosing, ambulatory ketones [fasting and after infusion set change], and&#xD;
      psychosocial questionnaires) will be collected and participants will complete an insulin&#xD;
      withdrawal test (IWT) and a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC) with indirect calorimetry&#xD;
      (IDC). Participants will then receive 12-week insulin-adjunctive treatments with both: (1)&#xD;
      SGLTi (sotagliflozin 200 mg daily) + Placebo and (2) SGLTi + GRA (volagidemab 35 mg weekly),&#xD;
      in a random-order, cross-over design with a 14-week washout period between treatment periods.&#xD;
      Throughout the treatment periods subjects will be seen weekly in clinic for medication dosing&#xD;
      (GRA or placebo) and download/review of CGM, insulin, and ketone data. At the end of each&#xD;
      treatment period, the baseline studies will be repeated. Subjects will return for a safety&#xD;
      follow up visit 6 weeks after the final GRA or placebo dose.&#xD;
