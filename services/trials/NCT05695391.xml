    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each patient must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. be male with a diagnosis of congenital hemophilia A or B of any severity&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. have one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. positive inhibitor test BU ≥5 (as confirmed at screening by the institutional&#xD;
                  lab) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. an inhibitor test BU &lt;5 (as confirmed at screening by the institutional lab) but&#xD;
                  expected to have an anamnestic response to FVIII or FIX, as demonstrated by a&#xD;
                  history of a high-responding inhibitor manifested by a previous anamnestic&#xD;
                  response, defined as a peak inhibitor titer &gt;5 BU after re-exposure to factor&#xD;
                  concentrates, precluding the use of FVIII or FIX products to treat or prevent&#xD;
                  bleeding OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. an inhibitor test BU &lt;5 (as confirmed at screening by the institutional lab) but&#xD;
                  expected to be refractory to FVIII or FIX, as demonstrated by the patient's&#xD;
                  history of previous failure to respond to FVIII or FIX concentrates, even in the&#xD;
                  absence of a documented anamnestic response, precluding the use of FVIII or FIX&#xD;
                  products to treat or prevent bleeding episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. be ≥12 years to ≤65 years of age on the day of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. be scheduled for an elective major surgical procedure as defined in the study protocol&#xD;
             (see Table ''Definitions for the specific purpose of Study F7TG2202'')&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. have Hb ≥ 12 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. be capable of understanding and willing to comply with the conditions of the protocol&#xD;
             OR in the case of a patient under the age of legal majority, parent(s)/legal&#xD;
             guardian(s) must be capable of understanding and willing to comply with the conditions&#xD;
             of the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. have read, understood, and provided written informed consent (patient or&#xD;
             parent(s)/legal guardian(s) if the patient is minor according to local regulation)&#xD;
             and, where applicable according to local regulation, patient's assent if the patient&#xD;
             is minor -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. have any coagulation disorder other than hemophilia A or B&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. be immunosuppressed (i.e. the patient should not be receiving systemic&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medication; CD4+ cell counts at screening should be &gt;200/μL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. known intolerance to LR769 or any of its excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. currently receiving immune tolerance induction (ITI) therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. have a known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to rabbits or rabbit proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. have platelet count &lt;100,000/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. have received an investigational drug within 30 days or within 5 half-lives of that&#xD;
             investigational drug, whichever is longer, of the planned first LR769 administration,&#xD;
             or be expected to receive such drug during participation in this study. Patients who&#xD;
             have received fitusiran in a clinical study may not participate in this clinical study&#xD;
             for 6 months since the last dose and if they have an antithrombin III level not in the&#xD;
             normal range at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. for patients using emicizumab, have received during the last 6 months or currently&#xD;
             receiving a maintenance dosing regimen of emicizumab different from the indicated one&#xD;
             ± 10% of approved dose), i.e. different from 1.5 mg/kg once weekly (±10%), 3 mg/kg&#xD;
             (±10%) every two weeks or 6 mg/kg (±10%) every four weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. for patients using emicizumab, currently be any plans, or notes in the patient's&#xD;
             medical records that would suggest the need to increase or decrease emicizumab dosing&#xD;
             due to antidrug antibodies (ADAs), reduced PK, or coagulation/safety-related issues&#xD;
             (e.g. lack of response, or potential/actual thromboembolic concerns, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. have a clinically relevant hepatic (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and/or alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase [ALT] &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) and/or renal&#xD;
             impairment (creatinine &gt;2 times the ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. have a history of arterial and/or venous thromboembolic events (such as myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, ischemic strokes, transient ischemic attacks, DVT, or PE) within 2 years&#xD;
             prior to the planned first dose of LR769, uncontrolled arrhythmia, or current New York&#xD;
             Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification score of stages II - IV&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. have an active malignancy (those with non-melanoma skin cancer are allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. have any life-threatening disease or other disease or condition which, according to&#xD;
             the investigator's judgment, could imply a potential hazard to the patient, or&#xD;
             interfere with the study participation or study outcome (e.g. chronic, unmanaged&#xD;
             hepatitis infection)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. be using aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), herbs, natural&#xD;
             medications, or other drugs with platelet inhibitory properties within one week prior&#xD;
             to surgery and for the duration of treatment with LR769&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. have active gastric or duodenal ulcer disease&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. have received a FVII- or FVIIa-containing product (either plasma derived or&#xD;
             recombinant) within 24 hours prior to administration of LR769&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. have a contraindication to antifibrinolytics&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. have planned combined major surgeries at the same time&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. be administered pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis within 5 half-lives of that&#xD;
             medication before surgery or for the duration of treatment with LR769 -&#xD;
