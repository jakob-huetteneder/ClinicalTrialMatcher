  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulse is a randomized non-inferiority phase III clinical trial assessing a new mode of&#xD;
      immunotherapy administration based on increased interval time between 2 infusions as&#xD;
      maintenance treatment in Pulse arm compared with the conventional administration in Control&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both treatment arms, pembrolizumab alone or combined with pemetrexed is allowed as&#xD;
      maintenance treatment. Indeed :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Pulse arm : Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered to patients every 6 weeks (Q6W)&#xD;
      plus, in the absence of contra-indication pemetrexed 500 mg/m^2 will be administered every 3&#xD;
      weeks (Q3W).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In control arm : Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered to patients every 3 weeks (Q3W) or&#xD;
      400 mg every 6 weeks plus,in the absence of contra-indication pemetrexed 500 mg/m^2 will be&#xD;
      administered every 3 weeks (Q3W).&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported outcomes via the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30).&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-C30 was developed to assess the quality of life of cancer subjects and is the most widely used cancer-specific HRQoL instrument. It contains 30 items and measures five functional dimensions (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), three symptom items (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), six single items (dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact) and global health and quality of life. The global health and quality of life scale uses a 7-point scale scoring with anchors (1=very poor and 7=excellent); the other items are scored on a 4 point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3= quite a bit, 4=very much).</description>

    <description>Patient reported outcomes via the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 13 (EORTC QLQ-LC13).&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-LC13 covers 13 typical symptoms of lung cancer patients, such as coughing, pain, dyspnea, sore mouth, peripheral neuropathy, and hair loss. It is scored on a 4 point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much).</description>

The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of five health state dimensions include the following: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is rated on a five-point scale from 1 (extreme problem) to 5 (no problem). The EQ-5D-5L also includes a graded (0 = The worst health you can imagine, to 100 = The best health you can imagine) vertical visual analog scale on which the subject rates his or her general state of health at the time of the assessment.</description>
