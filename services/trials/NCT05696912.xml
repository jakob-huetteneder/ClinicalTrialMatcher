  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rares diseases are a heterogeneous group of conditions which need important tools for&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of high-throughput sequencing is able to diagnose half of the patients. For the other&#xD;
      part it is impossible to conclude due to the presence of variants of unknown significance&#xD;
      (VOUS). Functional analysis are needed to bring strong argument to reclassify variants as&#xD;
      pathogenic or benign. The main objective is to evaluate the diagnosis yield of this strategy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is the improvement of the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases. The&#xD;
      investigator lab is expert for diagnosis of some rare diseases such as neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      disorder, albinism, cystic fibrosis and congenital heart defect. Actually with implementation&#xD;
      of high-throughput sequencing for diagnosis, a high number of genetic variants are found and&#xD;
      need to be interpretated. The ACMG classification is used to classify variants with argument&#xD;
      of variant frequency, predicted effect on protein and in-silico prediction. Functional&#xD;
      evidence is a strong argument to help classify VOUS. The investigators propose the use of&#xD;
      RNA-Seq, minigene and luciferase assay for study of VOUS to bring argument to classify them&#xD;
      as benign or pathogenic.&#xD;

    <description>It's the proportion of VOUS that could be definitively reclassified as pathogenic (class 5) or benign (class 1) according to the ACMG classification (Richards et al., 2015 and Appendix 1). Indeed currently only variants considered as pathogenic or probably pathogenic make it possible to confirm a diagnosis and to propose genetic offer genetic counseling to families and perform a prenatal diagnosis. This is an evaluation that will be carried out at the end of the analyses carried out</description>
