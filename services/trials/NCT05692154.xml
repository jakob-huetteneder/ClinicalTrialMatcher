    <textblock>
      This study is a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate if a daily dose of a 2-days&#xD;
      pre-treatment of Fexofenadine 180mg is effective in alleviating the AR symptoms and to assess&#xD;
      the additional benefit to the patient in terms of preventing Allergic Rhinitis (AR) symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study duration per participant is expected at least 4 months, depending on the&#xD;
      timing of the screening visit. 5 visits are planned, screening, confirmation inclusion&#xD;
      challenge, randomization visit, challenge and end of study visit.&#xD;

      The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all visits of&#xD;
      the study including Visit 5 (Day 5).&#xD;
