      This phase studies the engineered red blood cells with PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab（WTX212）,&#xD;
      the natural biological metabolic function of red blood cells can make the carried&#xD;
      pembrolizumab directionally distributed in the spleen tissue and activitate T cells,&#xD;
      suggesting that this product may solve the problem that PD-1 treatment failure.&#xD;

      The present study has 2 parts. The dose increasing stage is carried out according to the&#xD;
      &quot;3+3&quot; increasing principle. A total of 3 dose groups are preset (calculated by the number of&#xD;
      red blood cells of the pabolizumab loaded), which are respectively 20 × e10、60 × e10 and 100&#xD;
      × e10。 Subjects with IO resistant advanced solid tumor and recurrent refractory lymphoma were&#xD;
      studied. After the subjects passed the screening, blood was taken to prepare the engineered&#xD;
      red blood cell WTX212, and the test drug was administered once every 21 days. Subjects&#xD;
      completed the collection of PK, PD, biomarkers and immunogenicity samples during the&#xD;
      observation period of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) (within 21 days after the first&#xD;
      administration) and the continuous treatment period. After the end of DLT period of the first&#xD;
      subject in each dose group, the second subject can be accepted. The subject continues to&#xD;
      receive treatment until the subject suffers from intolerable toxicity, or withdraws informed&#xD;
      consent, or disease progression, or solid tumor subjects up to 12 months after the first&#xD;
      administration (lymphoma subjects can complete up to 6 administration cycles), or the end of&#xD;
      the study, or the investigator comprehensively decides to withdraw and start new anti-tumor&#xD;
      treatment according to the benefit of the subject, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
