  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was planned in a randomized controlled prospective experimental design in order to&#xD;
      determine the effect of mobile-based education given to patients undergoing gynecological&#xD;
      oncology surgery on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1. Education given with mobile application in gynecological oncology patients positively&#xD;
      affects symptom control of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2. The education given with the mobile application in gynecological oncology patients&#xD;
      positively affects the quality of life of the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Power analysis was conducted to determine the number of people to be included in the study.&#xD;
      The power of the test was calculated with the G*Power 3.1 program. As a result of the power&#xD;
      analysis, the sample size should be 50, 25 experimental and 25 control groups, at 95% power,&#xD;
      5% significance level, and 0.690 effect size (df=24; t=1,710). In the research, it was aimed&#xD;
      to reach a total of 70 women, 35 people in each group, considering the high power of the test&#xD;
      and the losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introductory Information Form, Symptom Evaluation Form, Functional Assessment of Cancer&#xD;
      Therapy-General (FACT-G) and Turkish-Computer System Usability Questionnaire (T-CSUQ- SV)&#xD;
      planned to be used as data collection tools in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women included in the study sample will be divided into two groups as experimental and&#xD;
      control groups according to randomization. Experimental group; the group to be trained.&#xD;
      control group; This is the group in which no attempt will be made other than data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis of Data: The data obtained in the research will be analyzed using SPSS&#xD;
      (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) for Windows 25.0 program. Homogeneity of&#xD;
      descriptive features between groups will be tested by chi-square analysis and independent&#xD;
      group t-test. The differentiation status of the scales between the groups will be analyzed&#xD;
      with the independent group t-test and the changes within the group will be analyzed with the&#xD;
      repeated measures ANOVA test.&#xD;
