  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lutetium Lu 177 dotatate works in treating patients with&#xD;
      prostate cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation that has spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body (metastatic). Neuroendocrine differentiation refers to cells that have traits of both&#xD;
      hormone-producing endocrine cells and nerve cells. These cells release hormones into the&#xD;
      blood in response to a signal from the nervous system. Hormones are biological substances&#xD;
      that circulate through the bloodstream to control the activity of other organs or cells in&#xD;
      the body. Lutetium Lu 177-dotate is a radioactive drug. It binds to a protein called&#xD;
      somatostatin receptor, which is found on some neuroendocrine tumor cells. Lutetium Lu&#xD;
      177-dotatate builds up in these cells and gives off radiation that may kill them. It is a&#xD;
      type of radioconjugate and a type of somatostatin analog. Treatment with Lutetium Lu 177&#xD;
      dotatate may shrink the tumor in a way that can be measured in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the objective response rate for patients treated with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate&#xD;
      using Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG) 3 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDAY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the 6-month radiographic progression-free survival of&#xD;
      neuroendocrine-differentiated prostate cancer treated with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine if the change in fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      signal from pre-treatment to after 2 doses of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate correlates with&#xD;
      objective response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the potential to perform patient-specific dosimetry of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate&#xD;
      using gamma imaging to predict treatment response and renal toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Perform gene expression analysis of circulating tumor cells to identify pre-treatment&#xD;
      biomarkers of response and signatures of resistance at the time of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lutetium Lu 177 dotatate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 6 weeks (Q6W) for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients also undergo positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scan at baseline and collection of blood throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed up at 6 weeks after last dose lutetium Lu 177 dotatate and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years after removal from study or until death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  No concurrent use of other anti-cancer therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy Precaution: The effects of lutetium lu 177 dotatate on the developing human&#xD;
             fetus are unknown. For this reason and because radionuclides are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, male participants and their female partners must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while her male partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of lutetium lu 177&#xD;
             dotatate administration. Patients must not donate sperm during the study and for 3&#xD;
             months after the last study drug administration&#xD;

             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity who have a legally-authorized&#xD;
             representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will undergo a Gallium 68 Dotatate PET scan after enrollment. The Gallium 68&#xD;
             Dotatate PET must be positive to proceed with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate therapy. A&#xD;
             positive scan will be defined as at least one lesion with an maximum standardized&#xD;
             uptake value (SUVmax) &gt; the average standardized uptake value (SUV) of normal liver.&#xD;
             The positive lesion(s) can be in any location (bone metastases or visceral&#xD;
             metastases). Patients with only bone metastases will be allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate&#xD;

             dotatate, use of long-acting somatostatin analogs (e.g., long-acting octreotide) is&#xD;
             prohibited within 4 weeks prior to initiating Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate and during&#xD;
             treatment. Use of short-acting somatostatin analogs is prohibited within 24 hours&#xD;
             prior to initiating Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate and during treatment. Long-acting&#xD;
             somatostatin analogs or short-acting somatostatin analogs will be allowed if the&#xD;
             patient has a history of carcinoid syndrome and requires long-acting or short-acting&#xD;
             somatostatin analogs for the control of his functional syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
