  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-centre, randomised, 3-way cross-over, clinical investigation comparing the&#xD;
      performance of two denture fixative versus no denture fixative control in full denture&#xD;
      wearers and an exploratory sub study in partial denture wearers. The study will assess the&#xD;
      performance and tolerance of two denture fixative cream formulations (Paraffin based and&#xD;
      Polydecene based) when applied to full dentures.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Denture Retention Assessment at 1hour</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour after denture fixative application or no fixative control</time_frame>
    <description>To assess denture retention of full maxillary arch after 1 hour with and without denture fixative using the Modified (Olshan) Kapur Index. Retention will be measured on score of 0-5 to assess the nature of resistance offered by the denture/denture fixative to vertical force. The higher the score, the higher the retention ability of the denture and fixative.</description>

    <description>To assess denture retention in full maxillary arch (and mandibular arch in fully edentulous participants) using the Modified (Olshan) Kapur Index at 5 and 30 minutes. Retention will be measured on score of 0-5 to assess the nature of resistance offered by the denture/denture fixative to vertical force. The higher the score, the higher the retention ability of the denture and fixative.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Satisfaction Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of each participant's day during the 4-day treatment period for each arm</time_frame>

    <measure>Oral Health Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>To be completed once during the participant's clinic visit on days 2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8 comparing with and without fixative</time_frame>
    <description>To make a clinical assessment of the oral health impact profile of participants using the Oral Health Impact Profile-Edentulous (OHIP-EDENT) questionnaires after 4 days use of each of the dental fixatives administered and no fixative control.</description>
