  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is an risk factor for cognitive impairment. The primary objective of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the efficacy of 12-week computerized cognitive training in people with&#xD;
      hypertension and mild cognitive impairment. The researchers will further investigate the&#xD;
      long-term effects of cognitive training by prolonging the intervention for 24 weeks among a&#xD;
      randomly selected sub-group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. A total of 200 hypertension&#xD;
      patients with mild cognitive impairment will be recruited to participate in this study after&#xD;
      screening. These patients will be randomized to two arms under masking. The intervention arm&#xD;
      will receive multi-domain adaptive cognitive training using a tablet. The control arm will&#xD;
      receive an active control treatment and use the same tablet to receive the cognitive training&#xD;
      tasks with weak difficulty change. Both arms will receive the same intervention dosage for 12&#xD;
      weeks, 5 times a week, and 30 minutes per time. After the 12-week intervention, the&#xD;
      intervention arm will be re-randomized into two groups. One group will stop their&#xD;
      intervention at 12 weeks; the other group will continue to receive the multi-domain adaptive&#xD;
      cognitive training till the 24-week follow-up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neuro-psychological assessment will be administered at baseline, 12-week, and 24-week&#xD;
      assessments for all participants. The structural and functional MRI will be administered at&#xD;
      baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks to evaluate the effect of cognitive training on brain&#xD;
      structure and function.&#xD;

    <measure>Global cognitive function change measured by BCAT in 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients whose global cognitive function improves 0.67SD compared to the baseline cognitive function measured by Basic Cognitive Ability Test (BCAT). BCAT is a set of neuropsychological battery tests which was designed to measure global cognitive fucntion and cognitive function of sub-domains. Higher scores of BCAT means a better global cognitive function.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This arm is the control arm. Participants randomized to this arm will use the same tablet to receive the cognitive training of low difficulty level with no adaptive change. The intervention dosage will be the same, which is 30 minutes each time, at least 5 times a week for 12 weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>Multi-domain adaptive cognitive training</intervention_name>
    <description>The multi-domain adaptive cognitive training covers seven aspects of fundamental cognitive function, including sensory perception, cognitive flexibility, attention, memory, language, logic calculation, and emotion recognition and management. A self-adaptive algorithm is embedded in the tablet-based cognitive training platform, which will help deliver suitable tasks at the right difficulty level for each participant according to their personal profile and real-time performance. The intervention dosage is 30 minutes per time, 5 times a week.</description>
