  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In West Africa, most people with serious mental illness receive care from traditional or&#xD;
      faith healers at prayer camps. The stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial aims to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a dual-pronged intervention package comprised of a mobile health program&#xD;
      designed to train healers to deliver evidence-based psychosocial interventions combined with&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy delivered directly to the patients at their prayer camps via a visiting nurse&#xD;
      in Ghana.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves deployment of an intervention in Ghanian prayer camps where traditional&#xD;
      and faith healers provide care for people with mental illness. The intervention has two&#xD;
      components: a visiting nurse that provides medications to patients staying at the prayer&#xD;
      camps combined with a smartphone app called M-Healer that is used by the staff working at the&#xD;
      camps. The app is designed to provide them with training on how to deliver some psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions, monitor the health and well-being of their patients, and protect human rights&#xD;
      at the camps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stepped-wedge cluster randomized study design involves all participant groups beginning&#xD;
      the trial receiving enhanced usual care with random sequential crossover of groups to the&#xD;
      experimental condition until all groups have been exposed to the full intervention.&#xD;
      Throughout the study, participant data will be collected at baseline, mid-treatment, and&#xD;
      post-treatment. Following study completion, the intervention will be evaluated by comparing&#xD;
      changes in psychiatric symptoms of participants from baseline to post-treatment.&#xD;
