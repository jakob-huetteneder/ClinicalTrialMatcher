      The investigators aim to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility of a&#xD;
      mind-body walking program compared to a health education program for individuals with chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain. The investigators will assess the feasibility of recruitment procedures&#xD;
      (enrollment, recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities) and intervention delivery&#xD;
      (fidelity, adherence, credibility, satisfaction, optimization), following pre-specified&#xD;
      benchmarks. Both programs will be delivered in-person.&#xD;

      The investigators aim to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility of a&#xD;
      mind-body walking program (GetActive with Steps!) compared to a health education program&#xD;
      (Healthy Living for Pain) for individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess the feasibility of recruitment procedures (enrollment, recruitment&#xD;
      of racial and ethnic minorities) and intervention delivery (fidelity, adherence, credibility,&#xD;
      satisfaction, optimization), following pre-specified benchmarks. Both programs will be&#xD;
      delivered in-person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each program will consist of ten 60-minute sessions in-person. Participants will receive a&#xD;
      treatment manual and ActiGraph watch to assess physical function. There are 3 assessment&#xD;
      points consisting of self-report surveys and performance-based measures: baseline,&#xD;
      post-program, and 6-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>GetActive with Steps! is an adaptation of the original GetActive-Fitbit program, a mind-body program for the unique needs of individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain that incorporates activity skills to help individuals improve all aspects of physical function. The GetActive with Steps! sessions address mind-body skills (e.g., mindfulness, deep breathing, self-compassion), walking skills (e.g., step goals, quota-based pacing), and skills to change thinking (e.g., identify unhelpful thoughts about pain and activity, challenging thoughts). The format is a 10-week program delivered in-person with weekly group sessions and home practice of skills and walking.</description>

    <description>Healthy Living for Pain is an active intervention that will be dose, attention, and time matches to the GetActive with Steps! program. Healthy Living for Pain is an adaptation of the Health Enhancement Program, developed by Dr. Vranceanu and colleagues from Stony Brook, with adjustments for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. The Healthy Living for Pain sessions provide educational information on chronic musculoskeletal pain, the role of sleep and nutrition, physical activity, healthcare management, medication use, and social connection. The format is a 10-week program delivered in-person with weekly group sessions and home practice journaling.</description>
