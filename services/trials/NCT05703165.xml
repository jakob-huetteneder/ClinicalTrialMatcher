  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the effects of an animal-assisted intervention on people with increased stress&#xD;
      levels are investigated. The data collected will be compared with those of participants with&#xD;
      high stress levels but without animal-assisted intervention (participants only observe&#xD;
      nature) and with a control group consisting of people without stress exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in the following setting: Questionnaire examination on chronic&#xD;
      stress, questionnaire on current well-being and heart rate variability (HRV) measurement&#xD;
      before the horse-assisted intervention, one HRV measurement and one questionnaire examination&#xD;
      (POMS) on current well-being after the horse-assisted intervention, one questionnaire (POMS)&#xD;
      on current well-being 5 days after the horse-assisted intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The early recognition of chronic stressors, which are often neglected by those affected until&#xD;
      physical symptoms appear, is of essential importance. In addition to psychopharmacological&#xD;
      therapy modalities, complementary methods such as animal-assisted intervention should also be&#xD;
      considered in order to expand the therapeutic spectrum and thus prevent stress-associated&#xD;
      consequential harms as early as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress has gained importance in recent years not only in the medical context, but also due to&#xD;
      its economic relevance. Chronic stress in particular leads to numerous medically relevant&#xD;
      secondary diseases and to increased sick leaves and even permanent incapacity to work. One&#xD;
      possible intervention to reduce stress could be animal-assisted intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: The use of animal-assisted intervention in people diagnosed with chronic&#xD;
      stressful situations will lead to measurable increases in heart rate variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis: The use of animal-assisted intervention in people diagnosed with&#xD;
      chronic stressful situations leads to improved well-being (target parameter: POMS&#xD;
      questionnaire)&#xD;
