  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If the video-polysomnographic (vPSG) recording in the laboratory remains the reference&#xD;
      examination in Sleep Medicine Centers for the diagnosis of sleep pathologies, the high&#xD;
      prevalence of sleep disorders in the general population and the growing demand for&#xD;
      exploration and management may require the use of alternative techniques such as new sleep&#xD;
      recording or analysis devices. In collaboration with the Creative Mechatronics Company&#xD;
      (Issoire) and the Ennery Confection Company (Le Puy en Velay), we have developed a &quot;portable&quot;&#xD;
      sleep detection prototype called Easy Sleep Monitoring (ESM) which consists of an&#xD;
      &quot;intelligent&quot; duvet equipped with a series of sensors capable of detecting movements and,&#xD;
      through this, estimating sleep duration and quantifying motor phenomena during sleep. Indeed,&#xD;
      it is a duvet which has in its thickness a grid of 35 electronic cards, equipped with an&#xD;
      actimetric sensor and a temperature sensor. The distribution of the sensors makes it possible&#xD;
      to detect the motor activity of the sleeper on all the body regions by considerably&#xD;
      increasing the sensitivity and specificity compared to actimetry at the wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantage of this duvet compared to other &quot;wearable&quot; devices is represented by its ease&#xD;
      of use, being less restrictive, having a reduced implementation time and not requiring the&#xD;
      user's collaboration. For example, it could be used for sleep monitoring in the elderly&#xD;
      and/or in a situation of hypomobility in the context of Residential establishment for&#xD;
      dependent elderly people or hospitals. At home, it could be a sleep monitoring tool, such as&#xD;
      monitoring treatment for insomnia, medicinal or not, or to monitor motor activity during&#xD;
      sleep, as in the monitoring of nocturnal akinesia in parkinsonian patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the concordance of sleep data obtained with&#xD;
      the ESM duvet with those obtained by video-polysomnography (vPSG). Indeed, the vPSG is the&#xD;
      gold standard examination in the study of sleep, the only one capable of exactly defining the&#xD;
      different stages of sleep and precisely quantifying sleep disorders.&#xD;

      Type of study : monocentric study, a proof of concept study of a new device for sleep&#xD;
      detection &quot;Easy Sleep Monitoring&quot; (ESM). This is a category 4.4 clinical investigation with a&#xD;
      non-CE marked medical device used in its indication, without the objective of CE marking or&#xD;
      establishing compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centers: 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be perdormed in 50 subjects (25 patients with sleep disorders (TS+) + 25&#xD;
      subjects without proven sleep disorders (TS-))&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study performance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will have 2 visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First visit (baseline, inclusion visit, 30 minutes) which will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Information and collection of written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recording of demographic and clinical data (age, sex, duration of disease&#xD;
                progression, current treatments, medical and surgical history)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pittsburgh PSQI Sleep Quality Index (for TS- group only)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Visit 2 (Month 6) (duration 1 night): The patients/controls will arrive in the evening&#xD;
           at the Sleep Laboratory (Functional Exploration Department of the Nervous System of the&#xD;
           Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital) to carry out complete vPSG and test the new ESM&#xD;
           &quot;intelligent duvet&quot; device.&#xD;

    <description>The patients/controls will arrive in the evening at the Sleep Laboratory (Functional Exploration Department of the Nervous System of the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital) to carry out complete vPSG and test the new ESM &quot;intelligent duvet&quot;device. A qualified technician will place the electrodes according to the procedures usually followed at the Sleep Center for vPSG recording. The ESM duvet will be placed on the patient's body as a blanket, instead of the blankets normally provided by the hospital. Patients/controls will be monitored overnight by an infrared video camera.</description>
