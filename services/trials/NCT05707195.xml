  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving the quality of care is a daily goal in pediatric intensive care units. Measuring&#xD;
      patient and family satisfaction is recognized as an indicator of quality of care. A validated&#xD;
      questionnaire was specially developed to study parental satisfaction in pediatric intensive&#xD;
      care units. A positive multi-professional analysis of clinical situations, using appreciative&#xD;
      inquiry, within a health service can create new opportunities for learning and innovation.&#xD;
      The establishment of such a Learning From Excellence (LfE) program tends to increase the&#xD;
      well-being and self-confidence of caregivers and promotes dynamic learning educational&#xD;
      programs, including simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It therefore seems important to assess the improvement in the quality of care in pediatric&#xD;
      intensive care following the implementation of a Learning From Excellence program allowing&#xD;
      positive reflection on practices as well as innovations within the service.&#xD;
