      Fibromyalgia is a chronic non inflammatory wide spread pain disorder associated with a&#xD;
      complex of symptoms as fatigue, depression and cognitive impairment , it is the second most&#xD;
      common disorder encountered in rheumatology practice (Berger et aL,2007) The pathophysiology&#xD;
      is certainly unclear involves a number of factors , including abnormalities in the&#xD;
      neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous system ,psychological variables, genetic factor, and&#xD;
      environmental stressors (Hudson JI, 2006 ) Fibromyalgia is no longer a diagnosis of exculsion&#xD;
      ,patient are diagnosed according to the American college of rheumatology diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      which requires a three conditions to be met a wide spread pain index &amp;gt;7 and symptom&#xD;
      severity scale score &amp;gt;5 or WPI from 3-6 and ss scale score &amp;gt;9, symptoms have been&#xD;
      present at similar level for at least 3 month and patient doesn't have a disorderthat would&#xD;
      otherwise explain the pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of fibromyalgia Treatment is to relieve the pain and improve quality of life and&#xD;
      physical function which need a&#xD;

      Final Version: April 2019Research Template 3 multifaceted treatment approach involving non&#xD;

      Lyftgot perineural injection therapy &amp;quot;lyftgot PIT&amp;quot; previously known as neural&#xD;
      prolotherapy , is a method of injection treatment designed and developed by DR Lyftgot from&#xD;
      new Zealand to treat the neurogenic inflammation and the neuropathic pain caused by the&#xD;
      sensocrine small nerve fiber .PIT is based on the injection of small amount of dextrose 5%in&#xD;
      a neutral PH sterile water solution in the subcutaneous tissue around the sick nerve to&#xD;
      correct the neuroglycopenia and to inhibit the neurogenic inflammation These small nerve&#xD;
      fibers are responsible for delivering to the tissue the nerve growth factors necessary for&#xD;
      the repair healing and reconstruction of the connective tissue system connecting the&#xD;
      superficial skin system to the deep myo-fascial-skeletal system and for restoration of its&#xD;
      original compostion with its normal osmotic and electro magnetic pressure (lyftogt,2007)&#xD;
      Dextrose 5% block the TRPV1 receptor which inhibit the propagation of the neuropathic pain&#xD;
      signal giving the patient the immediate analgesia , it also inhibit the neurogenic&#xD;
      inflammation and stimulate the release of nerve growth factor that help in thr repair PIT is&#xD;
      a novel , safe, effective and economical treatment for the pain felt in fibromyalgia In this&#xD;
      study we aim to asses the efficacy of this treatment in alleviating the pains felt by these&#xD;
      patients&#xD;
