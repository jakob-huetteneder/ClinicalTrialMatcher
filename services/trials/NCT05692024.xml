      This is research study is assessing the effects of 6-g daily use of freeze-dried instant&#xD;
      coffee on liver fat and fibrosis and the gut microbiome and metabolome in patients who have&#xD;
      undergone surgery for stage I or II colon cancer or undergone surgery and completed&#xD;
      chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer.&#xD;

      This research study is a chemoprevention clinical trial, designed to test the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in&#xD;
      treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to recruit 80 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coffee is a complex mixture of hundreds of bioactive compounds, including caffeine,&#xD;
           chlorogenic acids, and other polyphenols. Increasing data suggest the anti-cancer&#xD;
           benefit of coffee. Observational data have linked coffee drinking to better survival&#xD;
           among patients with colorectal cancer. However, there remains uncertainty surrounding&#xD;
           the mode of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved coffee as a treatment for&#xD;
           any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research study procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  screening for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound elastography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine, blood, and stool samples collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diet and lifestyle questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of archival tumor biopsy tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment: Coffee or placebo administered daily, orally for 8-12 weeks.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to&#xD;
        participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed stage I or II colon adenocarcinoma and&#xD;
             have completed surgical resection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed stage III colon adenocarcinoma and&#xD;
             have completed surgical resection and standard chemotherapy per the discretion of the&#xD;
             treating physician at least 2 months ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This study will only include adult participants because colorectal carcinogenesis in&#xD;
             children is more likely to be related to a cancer predisposition syndrome with&#xD;
             distinct biological mechanisms compared with sporadic colorectal cancer in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of coffee on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible&#xD;
        for admission into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants diagnosed with rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of other anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy agents, targeted&#xD;
             agents, biological agents, immunotherapy, or investigational agents not otherwise&#xD;
             specified in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regularly consuming more than 2 cups of coffee per day for at least 3 days a week in&#xD;
             the past month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent use (within 1 month) of any coffee supplements (e.g., green coffee&#xD;
             extracts).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of diagnosed conditions that may be worsen by coffee, including arrhythmias,&#xD;
             insomnia, tremors, tics, generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disease, panic attacks,&#xD;
             Tourette's, epilepsy or overactive bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of adverse reactions to coffee or intolerance of coffee consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness to swallow capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malabsorption or uncontrolled vomiting or diarrhea, or any other disease&#xD;
             that could interfere with absorption of oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the investigator, may&#xD;
             increase the risks associated with study participation or study treatment, limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements, or interfere with the interpretation of study&#xD;
             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding. The effects of coffee on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in&#xD;
        this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Similarly, lactating&#xD;
        women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but potential risk of&#xD;
        adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with coffee.&#xD;
        Consequently, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of synchronous (at the same time) malignancy for which the patient is&#xD;
             currently receiving active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, or&#xD;
             acute or chronic hepatitis B infection.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The results should be made public within 24 months of reaching the end of the study upon review by the MGH Research Pharmacy staff and acknowledgement of the CTP. The end of the study is the time point at which the last data items are to be reported, or after the outcome data are sufficiently mature for analysis, as defined in the section on Sample Size, Accrual Rate and Study Duration. If a report is planned to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, then that initial release may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. A full report of the outcomes should be made public no later than three (3) years after the end of the study.</ipd_description>
