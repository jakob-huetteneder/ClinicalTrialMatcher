  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The placement of a catheter in a large-caliber vein is sometimes necessary for the&#xD;
      administration of treatments or the monitoring of a patient. This may be associated with&#xD;
      complications during its realization, such as the puncture of an adjacent artery with&#xD;
      possible formation of a hematoma or the puncture of the pleura with creation of a&#xD;
      pneumothorax. These complications may be favored by variations in the anatomy. The use of&#xD;
      ultrasound allows visualization of the vessels, its adjacent structures and the puncture&#xD;
      needle along its path.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contribution of ultrasound with the technique of venipuncture under ultrasound guidance&#xD;
      is to date the best means of preventing complications by reducing the risk of early&#xD;
      mechanical complications by a factor of 5 to 10 according to the studies. The retrospective,&#xD;
      multicenter, observational study recently published by Björkander et al reported the&#xD;
      experience of 8 Swedish hospitals with 14243 central venous catheter placements, 58% of which&#xD;
      were in the internal jugular vein. Nearly one catheter in two was placed with the use of&#xD;
      ultrasound (49%). One hundred and eighteen mechanical complications were recorded, of which&#xD;
      23 were considered serious, including 21 pneumothoraxes and 2 severe hemorrhages. Lack of&#xD;
      ultrasound use was found to be an independent risk factor for complications in multivariate&#xD;
      analysis by logistic regression. Despite a high level of evidence in the scientific&#xD;
      literature on the contribution of ultrasound guidance for the placement of central venous&#xD;
      catheters, and the recommendations of national and international learned societies published&#xD;
      before the start of this study, almost one patient in two had not yet benefited from this&#xD;
      technique, which could nevertheless greatly reduce the incidence of early mechanical&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent introduction of ultra-portable ultrasound scanners could encourage the&#xD;
      generalization of the use of ultrasound, given their reduced cost. The hypothesis of the&#xD;
      research is that the placement of a central venous catheter is similar whether the ultrasound&#xD;
      machine is an ultra-portable ultrasound machine or a conventional ultrasound machine&#xD;
