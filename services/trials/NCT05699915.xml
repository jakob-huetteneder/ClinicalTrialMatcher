  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this prospective, multicentre study is to investigate short- and long-term&#xD;
      cardiovascular effects in cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question[s] it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate troponin and NT-proBNP values in patients receiving ICIs and their&#xD;
           association with ICI-induced CV abnormalities and MACEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the calcium score, systolic, and diastolic (dys)function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate associations between patient/disease characteristics / transthoracic&#xD;
           echocardiography parameters / electrocardiography parameters and troponin / NT-proBNP&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be closely monitored by performing the following additional visits and&#xD;
      testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest CT scan prior to treatment start, after 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consultation with a cardiologist at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, who will perform&#xD;
           an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One additional blood sample prior to treatment start, after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. An&#xD;
           extra blood sample could be taken in case of sudden heart problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-invasive endothelial function tests prior to treatment start, after 12 and 24&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the treatment of both advanced&#xD;
      and early stages of various malignancies has resulted in a substantial increase in the&#xD;
      incidence of cardiovascular immune related adverse events (irAEs). The current guidelines are&#xD;
      based on anecdotal evidence and expert opinions due to the lack of solid data and prospective&#xD;
      studies. Therefore, cardiac monitoring, in patients receiving ICIs, is often not implemented&#xD;
      by oncologists as many questions remain unanswered. Hence, the urgent need to investigate the&#xD;
      possible short and long term cardiovascular effects of ICIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators developed a multicentre, prospective study in which patients with a solid&#xD;
      tumour eligible for ICI treatment will be enrolled. The study exists of routine&#xD;
      investigations of blood parameters (troponin and (N-terminal) brain-type natriuretic peptide&#xD;
      levels in particular) and a thorough cardiovascular follow-up on fixed time points during a&#xD;
      period of two years. The cardiovascular follow-up consists of continuous remote patient&#xD;
      monitoring, routine cardiology consultations including electrocardiograms, transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiograms, CT-scans for calcium scoring and non-invasive endothelial function tests.&#xD;
      Associations between these blood parameters and short and long term cardiovascular irAEs will&#xD;
      be statistically analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will allow for a better estimate of the incidence of both short and long-term&#xD;
      cardiovascular irAEs in a 'real world' patient population receiving ICIs. If the&#xD;
      investigators are able to accurately predict and detect short- and long-term cardiovascular&#xD;
      irAEs in an early (and subclinical) stage by correct implementation and interpretation of&#xD;
      existing cardiac markers, they could be managed early on in a more effective manner.&#xD;

The right ventricular function will be evaluated by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and peak systolic velocity S' derived from color coded tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). Diastolic dysfunction will be based on average E/e' ratio &gt; 15 and left atrial (LA) area &gt; 30 cm2.</description>
