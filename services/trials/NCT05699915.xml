  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this prospective, multicentre study is to investigate short- and long-term&#xD;
      cardiovascular effects in cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question[s] it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate troponin and NT-proBNP values in patients receiving ICIs and their&#xD;
           association with ICI-induced CV abnormalities and MACEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the calcium score, systolic, and diastolic (dys)function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate associations between patient/disease characteristics / transthoracic&#xD;
           echocardiography parameters / electrocardiography parameters and troponin / NT-proBNP&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be closely monitored by performing the following additional visits and&#xD;
      testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest CT scan prior to treatment start, after 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consultation with a cardiologist at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, who will perform&#xD;
           an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One additional blood sample prior to treatment start, after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. An&#xD;
           extra blood sample could be taken in case of sudden heart problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-invasive endothelial function tests prior to treatment start, after 12 and 24&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the treatment of both advanced&#xD;
      and early stages of various malignancies has resulted in a substantial increase in the&#xD;
      incidence of cardiovascular immune related adverse events (irAEs). The current guidelines are&#xD;
      based on anecdotal evidence and expert opinions due to the lack of solid data and prospective&#xD;
      studies. Therefore, cardiac monitoring, in patients receiving ICIs, is often not implemented&#xD;
      by oncologists as many questions remain unanswered. Hence, the urgent need to investigate the&#xD;
      possible short and long term cardiovascular effects of ICIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators developed a multicentre, prospective study in which patients with a solid&#xD;
      tumour eligible for ICI treatment will be enrolled. The study exists of routine&#xD;
      investigations of blood parameters (troponin and (N-terminal) brain-type natriuretic peptide&#xD;
      levels in particular) and a thorough cardiovascular follow-up on fixed time points during a&#xD;
      period of two years. The cardiovascular follow-up consists of continuous remote patient&#xD;
      monitoring, routine cardiology consultations including electrocardiograms, transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiograms, CT-scans for calcium scoring and non-invasive endothelial function tests.&#xD;
      Associations between these blood parameters and short and long term cardiovascular irAEs will&#xD;
      be statistically analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will allow for a better estimate of the incidence of both short and long-term&#xD;
      cardiovascular irAEs in a 'real world' patient population receiving ICIs. If the&#xD;
      investigators are able to accurately predict and detect short- and long-term cardiovascular&#xD;
      irAEs in an early (and subclinical) stage by correct implementation and interpretation of&#xD;
      existing cardiac markers, they could be managed early on in a more effective manner.&#xD;
