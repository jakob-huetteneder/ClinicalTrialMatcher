  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of increasing doses of narazaciclib (ON&#xD;
      123300) in combination with the standard daily dose (2.5mg) of letrozole as second or third&#xD;
      line treatment in patients with Recurrent Metastatic Low-grade Endometrioid Endometrial&#xD;
      Cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2a, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      efficacy of escalating doses of narazaciclib (ON 123300) in combination with letrozole as the&#xD;
      second or third-line treatment for patients with recurrent metastatic low-grade endometrioid&#xD;
      endometrial cancer. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, eligible patients with documented recurrent metastatic LGEEC will be enrolled to&#xD;
      escalating dose cohorts. Cohorts will receive escalating doses of daily oral narazaciclib&#xD;
      starting at 160 mg orally, once daily, in combination with letrozole 2.5 mg orally, once&#xD;
      daily, in 28-day cycles in a typical 3 + 3 design. The dose of narazaciclib will be increased&#xD;
      in 40 mg/day increments from cohort to cohort until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or&#xD;
      the minimal biologically effective dose (MBED) of narazaciclib orally, once daily, in&#xD;
      combination with letrozole 2.5 mg orally, once daily, is reached and the RP2D of the&#xD;
      combination is established. Three to 6 patients will be enrolled per dose cohort in phase 1.&#xD;
      In Phase 2a, narazaciclib and letrozole at the RP2D established in Phase 1 will be&#xD;
      administered to approximately 30 eligible patients with documented recurrent metastatic LGEEC&#xD;
      for 28-day cycles. Treatment will continue until disease progression, patient withdrawal, or&#xD;
      unacceptable drug-related toxicity.&#xD;
