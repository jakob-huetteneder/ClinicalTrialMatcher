      The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about how unconditional cash payments equivalent&#xD;
      to $1,000 for 24 months (also called 'guaranteed income') might help families experiencing&#xD;
      homelessness and/or unstable housing in Santa Clara County, California.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the impact of guaranteed income on homelessness and housing stability among&#xD;
           families experiencing homelessness or housing instability?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the impact of guaranteed income on the health and well-being of families&#xD;
           experiencing homelessness or housing instability?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In terms of size and frequency of cash payments, do families prefer monthly recurrent&#xD;
           payments ($1,000/month) vs a larger up front amount followed by smaller monthly payments&#xD;
           ($6,500/month, then $500/month)? Is one payment strategy more helpful than the other in&#xD;
           terms of achieving improved housing stability, health, or other measures of well-being?&#xD;

      Study design and overall objective: This is a mixed-methods randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      to assess the effectiveness of guaranteed income on improving housing stability, health,&#xD;
      economic and overall well-being among 300 families experiencing homelessness in Santa Clara&#xD;
      County.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Assess the effect of guaranteed income on housing stability and homelessness. The&#xD;
      investigators will randomly select 150 households experiencing homelessness to receive&#xD;
      guaranteed income equivalent to $1000 per month for 24 months in addition to usual care, with&#xD;
      the remaining 150 households receiving usual care only (control group). The investigators&#xD;
      will assess and compare measures of housing stability, housing services use and emergency&#xD;
      shelter use at baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24, 27, 30, and 36 months after randomization.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Guaranteed income will improve housing stability and reduce the risk of&#xD;
      continuing homelessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Assess the effect of guaranteed income on the health and well-being of families&#xD;
      experiencing homelessness and their social networks. The investigators will assess and&#xD;
      compare self-reported physical and mental health and well-being, health and social service&#xD;
      use, employment and income volatility, financial assets and spending, food insecurity,&#xD;
      agency, and network strain and support at baseline and then at 6, 12, 18, 24, 27, 30, and 36&#xD;
      months after randomization. The investigators will use a mixed methods approach, employing&#xD;
      both validated survey instruments and qualitative interviews to assess measures of interest.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Families receiving guaranteed income will have improved health and well-being,&#xD;
      and multiplier effects will accrue to their social networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Assess the effect of monthly vs a hybrid payment strategy (larger up-front lump sum&#xD;
      plus a smaller monthly sum) on housing stability, health, and well-being. Individuals in the&#xD;
      guaranteed income group (intervention group) will self-select whether they prefer to receive&#xD;
      payments in a a) monthly ($1,000/month x 12 months) vs b) hybrid payment schedule ($6,500 x 1&#xD;
      month, then $500 x 11 month), with the option to change payment schedules after the first 12&#xD;
      months. Hypothesis: Individuals receiving a hybrid model of payments will obtain and sustain&#xD;
      positive changes in stable housing and well-being more successfully over time compared to&#xD;
      monthly payments.&#xD;

    <description>Measured through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Financial Well-Being survey. The ten items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale with each answer scored 0-4. A raw score is calculated from the sum of the ten items (range 0-40); the raw score is converted to a financial well-being score with adjustments for age and mode of survey administration. The range of financial well-being scores in adults 18 and older is 16-91 with higher scores corresponding to higher financial well-being.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. ≥18 years of age at baseline visit/assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Experiencing homelessness, as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The HEARTH Act; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Living in a public or private space intended for temporary (≤6 month) residence,&#xD;
                  such as residing in a hotel/motel;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Residing in a space without a legal right to the space and therefore being at&#xD;
                  threat of being asked to leave at any time (i.e., no lease); and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Being in a shared living situation intended to be temporary (i.e., being 'doubled&#xD;
                  up' due to lack of available and/or affordable housing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Vulnerability-Index Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool (VI-SPDAT) score&#xD;
             within the eligibility range for referral to rapid rehousing assistance programs in&#xD;
             Santa Clara County (score of 4-8 for households), if available at the time of study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - The VI-SPDAT score is commonly used by housing assistance service providers to&#xD;
             prioritize households for housing assistance programs, where households with scores of&#xD;
             0-3 are lower priority for referral to programs, and households with scores of 9+ are&#xD;
             recommended for referral to more intensive housing services such as permanent&#xD;
             supportive housing (which combine affordable housing assistance with voluntary support&#xD;
             services including health and mental health care, case management and other social&#xD;
             supportive services). Households with a score of 4-8 are considered most appropriate&#xD;
             for referral to housing assistance programs that may not offer additional supportive&#xD;
             services.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Living in a household with ≥1 dependent children (i.e., ≤17 years of age at the time&#xD;
             of study entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Written informed consent (and assent when applicable) obtained from participant or&#xD;
             participant's legal representative and ability for participant to comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Substantial to severe level of problematic substance use as defined by the validated&#xD;
             Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10) (score of 6-8 or 9-10, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption, or active and severe alcohol use disorder as&#xD;
             defined by the validated Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (score of&#xD;
             8-14 and ≥15, respectively).&#xD;
