      The efficacy and safety of yttrium-90 carbon microspheres in patients with unresectable&#xD;
      colorectal liver metastases remain unknown. This multicentre, prospective, open-label,&#xD;
      single-arm trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of yttrium-90 carbon&#xD;
      microspheres in patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases. The primary endpoints&#xD;
      are the progression-free survival rates of liver target lesions. While the secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include the safety, tumor control, and the distribution characteristics of&#xD;
      yttrium-90 carbon microspheres.&#xD;
