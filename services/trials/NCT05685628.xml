  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wounds can smell bad when they are necrotic, infected, malignant or complicated by fistulas&#xD;
      or abscesses. The discomfort and evocations (perception) associated with these smells can be&#xD;
      different from person to person. Foul odors are often associated with a repulsive effect.&#xD;
      Malodorous wounds can have negative social and psychological repercussions (shame,&#xD;
      depreciation, isolation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malodor is due to the presence of bacteria, whether the wound is colonized or infected.&#xD;
      Bacteria release Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) that emit these odors. There are a&#xD;
      multitude of anti-odor treatments (conventional or not) that highlight the difficulty of&#xD;
      effectively treating this symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Charcoal dressings are recommended. Charcoal does not treat the etiology, it is not odorous,&#xD;
      but it has the ability to adsorb VOCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To treat odor, the most prescribed antibiotic is Metronidazole, because its action targets&#xD;
      anaerobic bacteria whose presence increases odor. But repeated prescriptions of antibiotics&#xD;
      increase the risk of selection pressure, in addition to possible side effects. It's not&#xD;
      efficient in all the situations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another strategy is the application of local antimicrobials. But it is effective only if the&#xD;
      bacteria responsible for the odors are on the surface of the wound, which is not the case if&#xD;
      it is a tumor mass, thick necrosis or abscesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These local or general treatments do not completely control bad odors in all situations. A&#xD;
      new dressing combining adsorption capabilities (reduction of bad odors) with odor release&#xD;
      (modification of the perception of residual odors) with cinnamon (CINESTEAM®) is now&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work aims to evaluate this new medical device compared to the reference dressing&#xD;
      (charcoal) on quality of life, as well as criteria still poorly documented such as discomfort&#xD;
      and appetite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients with a reduction of at least 0.4 points in&#xD;
      the overall score on the Wound-Qol questionnaire (Quality of life). It is estimated that a&#xD;
      0.4 point reduction in the overall score is a clinically relevant reduction for patients and&#xD;
      reflects an improvement in their quality of life. An improvement of 0.4 points is expected in&#xD;
      25% of patients in the control arm (charcoal dressing) and in 55% of patients in the&#xD;
      experimental arm (cinnamon dressing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study provides for the inclusion of 98 people with malodorous wounds in 3 hospital&#xD;
      located on Ile de France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0: General data on the wound and current treatments will collected, Wound-Qol scale,&#xD;
      lifestyle, discomfort related to smell, evaluation of appetite. The evaluated dressings will&#xD;
      positioned on the top of primary dressing. They will fix by a non-occlusive or semi-occlusive&#xD;
      fixation. The entire dressing will changed 1 time a day for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: The patient will assess the discomfort related to the smell before changing the&#xD;
      dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3: Assessment of the employability of the dressing by the caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7 and 14: Assessment of the discomfort related to the smell by the patient, the caregiver&#xD;
      and the entourage. Appetite will assessed with the SEFI® scale. Day 14 only: Wound-Qol scale&#xD;
      and self-questionnaire on the appearance of any discomfort(s)/reaction(s) due to the&#xD;
      dressing.&#xD;

    <description>Wound-QoL (Questionnaire on quality of life with chronic wounds) measures the disease-specific, health-related quality of life of patients with chronic wounds. It can be used in clinical and observational studies as well as in daily practice. Two versions are available and we decided to use the original version (Wound-QoL-17) with 17 items. The primary endpoint is the reduction of more than 0.4 points in the overall score of the Wound-Qol quality of life questionnaire between D0 and D14.</description>
