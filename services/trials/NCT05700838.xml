  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Airway protection deficits (cough and swallowing) are prevalent and pervasive in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD), contributing to adverse health outcomes like pneumonia. This study aims to&#xD;
      refine cough skill training by examining whether variable versus constant practice conditions&#xD;
      improve cough outcomes in people with PD. In addition, this study will provide insight into&#xD;
      optimal respiratory adaptations that occur during training to support cough effectiveness,&#xD;
      resulting in immediately translatable treatments to improve airway protection-related health&#xD;
      outcomes in people with neurodegenerative disease.&#xD;

    <description>During cough skill training, participants will be seated in front of a computer with real-time visualization of their cough waveform. A target line will be provided, and participants will be instructed to perform a single voluntary cough so that their peak flow is within the target's range. Participants will be instructed to continue the cough training regardless of initial accuracy.</description>

    <description>Variable practice will involve three targets that reflect a range of cough airflows, including &quot;strong&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot;, and &quot;weak&quot; coughs.</description>
