  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the efficacy of group-based exercises using virtual reality on&#xD;
      activities of daily living in elderly population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a result of morphological and functional changes that occur with aging, complications such&#xD;
      as decrease in muscle mass, flexibility and muscle strength, decrease in sleep quality,&#xD;
      social isolation and chronic diseases develop and cause a decrease in independence in&#xD;
      activities of daily living (ADL). Increasing physical activity in the elderly is effective in&#xD;
      maintaining general health status and maintaining independence during activities of daily&#xD;
      living (ADL). However, the level of the participation to physical activities is quite low in&#xD;
      old age. It's known that group-based exercises and technology-supported exercise training&#xD;
      with virtual reality games increase participation in physical activity and improve motor&#xD;
      functions and ADL. But, there is no study examining the effect of technology-supported group&#xD;
      exercises on ADLs in the elderly. Therefore, the aim of our study is to find out the effects&#xD;
      of technology-supported group exercises on ADLs in the elderly over 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The forty-two participants will be recruited and divided into three equal groups randomly.&#xD;
      The group 1(n=14) will perform group-based virtual reality training and group 2(n=14) will&#xD;
      receive individual virtual reality training for 45-minutes, twice a week for eight weeks. The&#xD;
      third group group 3(n=14) will determined as the control group and they will continue their&#xD;
      routine daily activities. Primary outcome measure will be Barthel Index of Activities of&#xD;
      Daily Living. Secondary outcome measures will be Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly&#xD;
      (PASE), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Single Leg Stance Test (SLST), Six Minute Walk Test,&#xD;
      Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (Paces).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Each participant will be requested to draw either number one, number two or number three from a box. Number one will be allocated to group 1, number two will be allocated o group 2 and number two will be allocated o group 3. The group 1 consists of 14 elderly participants who received intervention protocol of group- based virtual reality training program in which total 16-sessions were given for twice a week for eight weeks for 45-minutes. The group 2 consists of 14 elderly participants who received intervention protocol of individual virtual reality training in which total 16-sessions were given for twice a week for eight weeks for 45-minutes. The group 3 consists of 14 elderly participants will continue their routine daily activities.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index, measures the extent to which somebody can function independently and has mobility in their activities of daily living (ADL) i.e. feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, bowel control, bladder control, toileting, chair transfer, ambulation and stair climbing. Total scores range from 0 - 20, with lower scores indicating increased disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly is a brief (5 minutes) and easily scored survey designed specifically to assess physical activity in epidemiological studies of person age 65 years and older. The total score ranges from 0 to 400 or more and high scores show better physical activity levels.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time Up and Go is a very simple, quick, valid, reliable and an objective test which is used for the assessment of balance and mobility.</description>

    <measure>Single Leg Stance Test (SLST)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Single Leg Stance Test (SLST) test is used to assess balance. For the test, volunteers were asked to lift one foot without touching the support leg.</description>

    <measure>Geriatric Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument evaluate depressive symptoms using yes/no answers. Of the 15 items, 10 indicate the presence of depression when answered positively while the other 5 are indicative of depression when answered negatively</description>
