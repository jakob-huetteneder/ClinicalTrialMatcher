      This is an open-label phase II study, with the aim of investigating the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of Tislelizumab + Fruquintinib combination therapy in ARID1A-mutated pMMR/MSS metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer who have been treated with standard chemotherapy that includes&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Patients with hypermutated CRC that carries&#xD;
      POLE/POLD1 mutations cannot be included.&#xD;

      In this open-label phase II study, patients with ARID1A-mutated pMMR/MSS metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer who have been treated with standard chemotherapy that includes&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, will be scheduled for Tislelizumab (200mg&#xD;
      ivdrip Q3W day1) + Fruquintinib (5mg/day Q3W day1-14) until intolerable toxicity, disease&#xD;
      progression or death. Primary endpoint of this study is ORR and secondary endpoints are OS,&#xD;
      PFS, DCR and safety.&#xD;
