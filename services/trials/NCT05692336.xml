    <textblock>
      the study is carried out to identify If there is any difference between the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Vestibular training and Dual task training on balance in children with Diplegic Cerebral&#xD;
      Palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      so in this study the sample will be divided into two equal groups, each group will recieve&#xD;
      only one type of training ( vestibular training or dual task training ) the balance of the&#xD;
      diplegic children will be assessed before and after using HUMAC balance system and pediatric&#xD;
      balance scale , the results will be compared between both groups and if there is one training&#xD;
      is more effective than the other , it will be recommended most in the future treatment&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A comparative experimental design was used. Children participating in this study were&#xD;
      assigned into two equal groups, Thirty four children with diplegic Cerebral Palsy of both&#xD;
      genders who have balance problems were selected to join this study with the following&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. all the children diagnosed as diplegic cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Their age are range from 5 to 10 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The degree of spasticity is between grade 1 or 1+ according to Modified Ashworth Scale&#xD;
           (Charalambous ,2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. They are at level I OR II on Gross Motor Function Classification System .&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All the children were able to follow verbal command and instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And Children were excluded in the presence of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children that suffer from epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Severe visual and auditory problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Structural or fixed soft tissue deformities of Lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Severe mental retardation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Botox injection in the lower extremity in the past 6 months..&#xD;
&#xD;
      all the children will be assigned in one of two groups ( vestibular training group and dual&#xD;
      task group ) the training will be continue for definite period of time , and the balance&#xD;
      abilities for the children in each group will be assessed before and after the treatment&#xD;
      completely ended and the result will be compared to conclude which group benefit more and&#xD;
      have a greater balance improvement and the treatment that causes a greater improvement will&#xD;
      be more recommended in the future physical therapy plan for treatment of diplegic cerebral&#xD;
      palsied children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the balance is assessed using HUMAC balance system and pediatric balance scale .&#xD;
