      This study consists of two parts: Phase I and Phase II. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability of MRG003 in combination with HX008 in patients with&#xD;
      EGFR-positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors; and to explore the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of combination therapy; and to&#xD;
      evaluate the preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of combination&#xD;
      therapy in the targeted study population.&#xD;
