  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single-arm, dose escalation study, to explore the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy of human amniotic epithelial stem cells (hAESCs) for idiopathic&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      hAESCs will be administration through the Ommaya reservoir implanted into the lateral&#xD;
      ventricle of subjects with idiopathic PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This dose escalation will be followed by an exploratory expansion phase in 3 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose A (5×10^7 cells/dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose B (1.0×10^8 cells/dose)&#xD;

    <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-completed questionnaire assessing how often people with Parkinson's experience difficulties across 8 dimensions of daily living with 39 questions . Questions are answered using a 5-point ordinal scoring system: 0 = never, 1 = occasionally, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = always. Each scores range from 0 = never have difficulty to 100 = always have difficulty.The higher the score, the lower the quality of life of PD patients.</description>

    <description>The HAMD-17 Scale is the most widely used scale in clinical evaluation of depression in PD patients. This project takes 8 points as the critical value of depression, and the total score over 35 points is considered as severe depression, more than 20 points is likely to be diagnosed with depression, less than 8 points is not depressed.</description>

Scores range from 0 (poorly or often) to 10 (very good or never), with a total score of &lt;90 indicating sleep disturbance, with higher scores indicating better sleep quality.</description>
