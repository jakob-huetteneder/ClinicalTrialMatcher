  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment of&#xD;
      Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) using a new modality based on high-intensity focused ultrasound&#xD;
      (HIFU). BCC is the most common type of skin cancer in Europe, Australia and the US. It&#xD;
      accounts for more than 75% of all skin cancer cases in those regions. There are currently&#xD;
      more the 14000 BCC cases registrations in Poland every year, and occurrences on a global&#xD;
      scale are counted in several millions per year. Given the trend of aging population those&#xD;
      numbers will only increase with time. Finding new and more effective treatment methods are&#xD;
      therefore highly relevant from both a clinical and socioeconomic perspective. The&#xD;
      investigational device used in the study is a system capable of making controlled and&#xD;
      targeted thermo-mechanical treatment of small intradermal volumes containing e.g. BCC cells,&#xD;
      but without inflicting damage to the surrounding tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation involves an evaluation of the safety and efficacy profile 3 months after a&#xD;
      single few-minute treatment. Subsequent follow-up of secondary endpoints is done every third&#xD;
      month until the end of the study one year after the treatment.&#xD;
