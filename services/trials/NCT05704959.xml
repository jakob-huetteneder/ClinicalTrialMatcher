      Povidone iodine is still a commonly used antiseptic in hospitals. Although pulse oximetry&#xD;
      measurement is used as an important indicator in hospitals, no study has been found examining&#xD;
      the effect of povidone iodine on the nail bed on the pulse oximetry result.&#xD;

      Povidone iodine is still a commonly used antiseptic in hospitals. Although pulse oximetry&#xD;
      measurement is used as an important indicator in hospitals, no study has been found examining&#xD;
      the effect of povidone iodine on the nail bed on the pulse oximetry result. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the effect of 10% povidone iodine on the nail bed on the oxygen&#xD;
      saturation reading in pulse oximetry.&#xD;

    <description>Reference measurements were made simultaneously with two separate calibrated pulse oximeter devices from the index, middle and ring fingers of both hands of the participants. One layer of 10% povidone iodine was applied to the index finger, two layers to the middle finger, and three layers to the ring finger of one hand of the participant's choice. Two pulse oximetry measurements were made with the fingers of the other hand, immediately after the application of povidone-iodine and three minutes later, and it was noted on the data collection form.</description>
