  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, First-in-Human (FIH), randomized, single-blind, sponsor-open,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, SAD sequential group design study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of four parts: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening Period of maximum 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Treatment Period during which subjects will be resident at the Clinical Unit from 2&#xD;
           days before IMP (Investigational Medicinal Product) administration (Day -2) until at&#xD;
           least 48 hours after IMP administration; discharged on Day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • A second Treatment Period during which subjects will be resident at the Clinical Unit from&#xD;
      the day of the Follow-up Visit (Day 7 ±1 days after the last IMP dose) until at least 48&#xD;
      hours after the second IMP administration; discharged on Day 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • A Follow-up Visit after 7 (Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3) or 14 (Part 4) ±1 day after the last&#xD;
      IMP dose.&#xD;
