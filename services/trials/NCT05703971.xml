      This clinical trial will evaluate the combination of quaratusugene ozeplasmid with&#xD;
      atezolizumab as maintenance therapy for patients with Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer&#xD;
      (ES-SCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 phases, a dose selection phase (Phase 1) and a safety and&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation phase (Phase 2).&#xD;

      Acclaim-3 is an open-label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study evaluating the combination of&#xD;
      quaratusugene ozeplasmid with atezolizumab as maintenance therapy for patients with ES-SCLC&#xD;
      who did not develop tumor progression after receiving at least 3 cycles, and no more than 4&#xD;
      cycles, of induction therapy with carboplatin plus etoposide and atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicities will be assessed by the Investigator using United States National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Serious Adverse&#xD;
      Events and Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) will be reviewed by a safety review committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: In Phase 1 dose selection, patients will be enrolled in sequential cohorts treated&#xD;
      with successively higher doses of quaratusugene ozeplasmid in combination with atezolizumab.&#xD;
      The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of quaratusugene ozeplasmid when given in combination&#xD;
      with atezolizumab will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Quaratusugene ozeplasmid in combination with atezolizumab will be further evaluated&#xD;
      using the RP2D identified in Phase 1.&#xD;

    <description>Quaratusugene ozeplasmid is an experimental nonviral immunogene therapy utilizing the TUSC2 gene, designed to target cancer cells by interrupting cell signaling pathways that allow cancer cells to grow, reestablishing pathways that promote cancer cell death and modulating the immune response against cancer cells.</description>

    <description>Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that binds to the programmed death-receptor 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions.</description>
