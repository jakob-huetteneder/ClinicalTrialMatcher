      Cyclic, 5-day calorie restriction is a safe metabolic intervention when combined with&#xD;
      standard therapies in cancer patients, favorably reshaping peripheral blood and intratumor&#xD;
      metabolism and immunity in a way that may improve the antitumor activity and efficacy of&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical trial is to test if combining cyclic, 5-day calorie restriction&#xD;
      with atezolizumab maintenance in patients with ES SCLC achieving at least stable disease&#xD;
      after four cycles of induction atezolizumab plus carboplatin and etoposide chemoimmunotherapy&#xD;
      may increase the efficacy of a standard first-line, chemo-immunotherapy approach in terms of&#xD;
      patient PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question it aims to answer is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • does the combination of cyclic, 5-day calorie restriction with triweekly atezolizumab&#xD;
      increase the 6 months PFS rate, as evaluated from maintenance treatment initiation, compared&#xD;
      to historical results with standard atezolizumab maintenance monotherapy in patients with ES&#xD;
      SCLC non-progressive after four cycles of first-line chemo-immunotherapy induction with&#xD;
      atezolizumab plus carboplatin and etoposide?&#xD;

      SCLC is the most aggressive and deadly subtype of lung cancer. Indeed, despite the novel&#xD;
      treatment strategies, patients with ES SCLC still have a dismal prognosis. The most relevant&#xD;
      therapeutic progress that occurred in the last decades in the treatment of this disease&#xD;
      consists in the combination of immunotherapy (anti PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies) with standard&#xD;
      cytotoxic chemotherapy as the first-line treatment. However, in clinical trials that led to&#xD;
      the registration of currently used chemoimmunotherapy combination regimens, the addition of&#xD;
      immunotherapy to chemotherapy approaches only led to a marginal increase in patient PFS and&#xD;
      OS. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are needed to increase the efficacy of&#xD;
      chemo-immunotherapy approaches. Pre-clinical and translational evidence suggests that&#xD;
      patients with ES SCLC receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents may benefit from the combination of&#xD;
      cyclic, short-term calorie restriction to immunotherapy both for reasons related to the&#xD;
      metabolic vulnerabilities of SCLC cells (e.g., enhanced glycolysis) and their potential&#xD;
      sensitivity to glucose-lowering strategies, and to the potential synergistic antitumor&#xD;
      effects resulting from the combination of immunotherapy with cyclic calorie restriction.&#xD;
      Based on these data, we design the FASTIMMUNE trial, a single center, open-label, single arm,&#xD;
      phase II clinical study with a Simon's two-stage design. The study consists of 2 phases: an&#xD;
      induction phase and an experimental maintenance treatment phase. Participants will undergo an&#xD;
      experimental maintenance treatment with triweekly cycles of 5-day calorie restriction (on&#xD;
      days -2 through 2 of each cycle) in combination with atezolizumab (at a dose of 1200 mg,&#xD;
      administered intravenously on day 0 of each cycle) until the occurrence of unacceptable toxic&#xD;
      effects, disease progression, consent withdrawal or patient death. Patients interrupting&#xD;
      cyclic calorie restriction for any reason other than disease progression may continue the&#xD;
      maintenance treatment with atezolizumab alone, if clinically indicated.&#xD;
