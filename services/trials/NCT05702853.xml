  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, nonrandomized, open-label dose-escalation study followed by&#xD;
      dose-expansion of CD19- CD34t metabolically programmed CAR T-cell therapy in adult patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory CD19 B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although CD19 CAR T-cell therapy is a dynamic scientific and clinical breakthrough for CD19+&#xD;
      NHL, issues still remain in terms of relapse, toxicity, and availability. This trial will&#xD;
      incorporate a CD34 tag (CD34t) into the CAR T-cell construct, thus allowing a more purified&#xD;
      CAR T-cell product via CD34 selection. This purification step will hopefully lead to an&#xD;
      improvement in safety/toxicity. Furthermore, the issue of CD19 CAR T-cell relapse has been&#xD;
      linked to a lack of CAR T-cell fitness. With the knowledge that Th1 T-cell subsets have&#xD;
      improved effector function and Th17 T-cell subsets have improved persistence, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to expose the collected T-cells to priming conditions that lead to a&#xD;
      metabolically enhanced CAR-T cell product akin to a Th1/17 hybrid cell. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that these metabolically programmed CD19 CAR-T cells will yield a high- quality&#xD;
      product with enhanced persistence and anti-tumor efficacy when purified based on CD34t&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
