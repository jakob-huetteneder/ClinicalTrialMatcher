  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the effects of phase-targeted auditory&#xD;
      stimulation in depressed patients and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is auditory down-phase stimulation efficient in improving depression symptoms as&#xD;
           compared to sham stimulation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can mood and other outcomes be prospectively estimated by multi-parametric passive data?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform auditory stimulation using a wearable device at home and provide&#xD;
      data on their phone usage and activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare depressed patients and healthy participants to see if auditory&#xD;
      down-phase stimulation effects them differently.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL TRIAL PART: This part will be conducted in depressed and age- and sex-matched&#xD;
      healthy participants. It has a double-blind, randomized crossover design. Each participant&#xD;
      will undergo 1 week of baseline monitoring, followed by 1 week of in-home stimulation and 1&#xD;
      week of placebo condition interleaved with 1 week wash-out period. The last night of each&#xD;
      intervention week will take place in a laboratory setting. A final week of follow-up will&#xD;
      follow the second intervention week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data is collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single-channel EEG (at home) and high-density electroencephalogram (hdEEG) (in&#xD;
           laboratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MR imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive behavioural and physiological measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONITORING PART: This observational study part will be conducted in depressed participants&#xD;
      only. Each participant will undergo 5 weeks of remote monitoring using wearable devices and&#xD;
      smartphones. Patients not eligible for the CLINICAL TRIAL PART, or that meet an exclusion&#xD;
      criterion at any point in the study, can be assigned to this study part.&#xD;
