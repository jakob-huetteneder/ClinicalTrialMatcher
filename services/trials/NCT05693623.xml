      Purpose: Cold application is considered as an effective alternative treatment for labor&#xD;
      comfort because of its low side effects and easy availability. This study aims to determine&#xD;
      the effect of cold application to the sacral area in the transition phase of labor on labor&#xD;
      comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: The study was done as a randomised controlled experimental study.&#xD;
      While the women in the experimental group received cold application for 10 minutes every 20&#xD;
      minutes after 8 cm of cervical dilatation, the women in control group received routine care&#xD;
      protocol of the unit.&#xD;
