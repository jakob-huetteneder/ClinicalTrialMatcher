  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine how cognitive control training (CCT) changes&#xD;
      behavior in youth with subclinical depressive symptoms. This research will show what types of&#xD;
      behavior changes are important for CCT to help reduce depressive symptoms. In the future, we&#xD;
      will use this information to try to improve how we prevent the development of depression, so&#xD;
      that it can help more patients.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NIHTB (NIHTB) cognitive battery consists of 10 tasks and can be administered in 40 min. The scores can be evaluated separately, or they can be combined into composite scores: crystallized cognition composite (reflecting the ability to access information from long-term memory and general knowledge), fluid cognition composite (reflecting the processing ability to adapt to novel environment and solve problems), and overall cognitive function composite (a combination of both crystallized and fluid scores).</description>
