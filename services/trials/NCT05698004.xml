  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to the ICU with severe hypoxemia are at high risk for mortality. Few&#xD;
      therapies have been proven to improve patient outcomes or duration of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      e.g. low tidal volume ventilation, prone positioning, and a fluid-restrictive strategy. Prone&#xD;
      positioning is a technique used to help patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      breathe better. There is high degree of uncertainty on its effects on clinical outcomes in&#xD;
      non-intubated patients with acute hypoxemia and larger studies are needed.&#xD;

      we plan to study the effect of prone positioning versus standard treatment in non-intubated&#xD;
      patients with acute hypoxemia admitted at Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU), Chest&#xD;
      Department, Assiut University Hospital, Egypt.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure attending the participating centres will receive either prone positioning + standard treatment or standard treatment only. All new acute hypoxemic respiratory failure patients will receive prone positioning + standard treatment for the first two weeks of the study. During the following two weeks, all new patients will receive standard treatment only. These cycles will be repeated until completion the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the intervention group will be subjected to awake prone positioning. The target duration of prone positioning is 8 h/d to 10 h/d with 2 to 3 breaks (1-2 hours each), if needed. Daily prone positioning sessions will be protocolized to continue until 1 of the following stopping criteria is met: a relative improvement in the FIO2 requirement by 40% from the baseline value that sustained for 24 hours; endotracheal intubation; or discharge from the ICU. The treating team will supervise patients who could move themselves during the prone positioning process and assist the patients with positioning as required.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the control group, and their treating team, will be informed of their group assignment. Nurses instruct patients not to position themselves in the prone position.</description>
