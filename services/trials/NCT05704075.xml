  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TTT is a novel surgical technique that may potentially solve the long-standing deficit of&#xD;
      seeking effective treatment for diabetic foot ulcers, decreasing the need for amputations and&#xD;
      softening the socio-economic impact it brings. This trial will be the world's first&#xD;
      prospective RCT to verify the promising clinical studies on the clinical benefit of TTT in&#xD;
      treating diabetic foot ulcers. In addition, blood samples from this study will allow us to&#xD;
      study the various systemic circulating soluble factors in relation to neovascularisation,&#xD;
      immunomodulation, and stem cell mobilisation. By taking the blood and various time points, we&#xD;
      will better understand the complex interplay between various biomarkers. This GRF will allow&#xD;
      us to obtain tissue samples to analyse the histological cellular changes after TTT surgery.&#xD;
      It will provide us with more insight on how TTT works, as well as potentially helping us&#xD;
      pinpoint the important changes and timeframes related to this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI, Co-Is and collaborators create a strong team of clinicians and scientists with a&#xD;
      solid clinical and basic science track record. The team has published guidelines and surgical&#xD;
      techniques in TTT and run several training cadaveric workshops teaching the TTT surgical&#xD;
      technique to local orthopaedic surgeons. The team has also established a rat TTT model and&#xD;
      published on TTT immunomodulation and neovascularisation in addition to other ongoing&#xD;
      mechanistic experiments in animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective multi-centre randomised controlled trial may act as the foundation for&#xD;
      launching this cost-effective TTT surgery to regulate neovascularisation, neurogenesis,&#xD;
      immunomodulation and mobilisation of MSCs for the treatment of various chronic conditions.&#xD;
      Regenerative medicine is a multi-million dollar industry, and the potential use of TTT can&#xD;
      result in a range of clinical applications not limited to DFUs.&#xD;

    <description>10ml of peripheral blood will be collected at multiple timepoints. Each peripheral blood samples will be collected using tubes containing K2-EDTA. Blood samples will be centrifuged at 1800g for 6 min at 4 °C to get plasma and apportioned into 1 mL aliquots and stored at -80 °C. Differential protein expression will be determined by 8-plex isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics analysis.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transverse Tibial Transport (TTT)</intervention_name>
    <description>Transverse tibial transport is a novel adaptation of concepts used in distraction histogenesis. The most common use of this surgical principle is in bone lengthening surgery, which is a well-established surgical procedure by applying an external fixator to the bone, creating a corticotomy, and gradually lengthening the bone at the optimal rate of 0.5mm/12hrs. The biological mechanisms of distraction histogenesis involve activating signalling pathways such as cytokines Interleukin 1 and Interleukin 6, pro-inflammatory markers TNF alpha, pro-osteogenic TGF-beta, BMPs and pro-angiogenic factors VEGF and angiopoietin . TTT utilises the concept of distraction histiogenesis, but distraction is performed in the transverse plane instead of a longitudinal distraction. In addition, the period of distraction is coupled with a corresponding compression period and ultimately results in no net change in limb length.</description>
