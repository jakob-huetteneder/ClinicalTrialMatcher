      The purpose of the study is to compare the sensitivity and specificity of transoral&#xD;
      ultrasound, transcervical ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography-Computerized Tomography (PET-CT) in terms of detecting primary oropharynx tumors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A prospective study will be performed at the head &amp; neck departments at Copenhagen University&#xD;
      Hospital - Rigshospitalet, Zealand University Hospital - KÃ¸ge, and Aarhus University Hospital&#xD;
      in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred with a suspected cancerous lesion of the oropharynx will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in this study. With written informed consent, a surgeon-performed outpatient&#xD;
      transoral and transcervical examination of the tonsils and tongue base is conducted as an&#xD;
      addition to the clinical workup at the head &amp; neck departments. Clinical work-up includes&#xD;
      palpation of the oropharynx, flexible endoscopic exam with narrow-band imaging and neck&#xD;
      ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound of the oropharynx will be performed using small-footprint, high-frequency (minimum&#xD;
      15MHz) transducers for transoral ultrasound. A lower-frequency (between 2-9 MHz) curved&#xD;
      transducer will be used for transcervical ultrasound. If a suspected tumor is visualized, the&#xD;
      location is noted and the surgeon performing clinical examination is informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI will be performed on all patients, and two expert neuroradiologist blinded to ultrasound&#xD;
      results will separately assess all images for tumor detection, greatest tumor size and&#xD;
      T-stage. Interrater reliability analysis will be performed comparing the tumor detection,&#xD;
      greatest tumor size and T-stage between both MRI readers. In case of patients with suspected&#xD;
      cervical metastasis with no suspected primary tumor on initial clinical exam, a PET-CT will&#xD;
      also be performed and compared blinded to ultrasound and MRI. The ultrasound operator will be&#xD;
      blinded to all MRI and PET-CT results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeons performing initial clinical work-up, the ultrasound operators, neuroradiologist and&#xD;
      nuclear medicine physician will register tumor detection (sub-location specific) and greatest&#xD;
      tumor size immediately and prospectively, blinded to histopathology. Prospective gathered&#xD;
      data will be registered on standardized data collection sheets or in REDCap using the same&#xD;
      standardized variables. All scanning modalities will be evaluated blinded to each other but&#xD;
      not to clinical findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor detection: Suspected tumor locations from clinical evaluation with narrowband imaging&#xD;
      and palpation, ultrasound, MRI, and PET-CT will be categorized according to the following&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right tonsil&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left tonsil&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right tongue base&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left tongue base&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right overlapping tonsil and tongue base&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left overlapping tonsil and tongue base&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other oropharynx (soft palate, uvula, anterior and posterior pharyngeal arches,&#xD;
           posterior oropharynx wall, and vallecula)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple tumor locations The examiners' tumor suspicion confidence will be rated with a&#xD;
           5-point Likert scale ranging from 0, very low suspicion - 5, very high suspicion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon will also mark on a pictogram of the oropharynx with the biopsy location(s)&#xD;
      numbered according to the histopathology registered biopsy locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor size and staging: If a tumor is visualized or palpated, the greatest tumor diameter&#xD;
      will be measured in three dimensions with clinical palpation, ultrasound, and MRI. T-staging&#xD;
      will be estimated according to the Union for International Cancer Control 8th edition&#xD;
      TNM-staging system:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tx: Unknown primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T1: Tumor &lt;20 mm in greatest diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2: Tumor 21-40 mm in greatest diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T3: Greatest size &gt;40mm or extension to the lingual surface of the epiglottis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T4: Invasion of the extrinsic tongue muscles, larynx, pterygoid muscles, hard palate,&#xD;
           mandible, carotids nasopharynx or skull base (yes, no, indeterminate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional variables: We will prospectively register the study center, date of outpatient&#xD;
      ultrasound, ultrasound machine used, doctor performing the ultrasound scan, patient&#xD;
      Mallampati 4-point score, Patient mouth opening measured in millimeters between incisors,&#xD;
      patient self-reported discomfort from transoral ultrasound and palpation examinations&#xD;
      (Supplementary Figure 2), ultrasound scan quality, MRI scan quality and PET-CT scan quality.&#xD;
      Quality will be registered on a 5-point Likert scale (1, Very poor quality - 5, excellent&#xD;
      quality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be registered from medical charts: patient age, sex, tobacco smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption, date of first clinical contact, date of MRI scan performed, date of&#xD;
      PET/CT scan performed, date of available histopathology results and date of treatment&#xD;
      initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound video clips and B-mode images will be stored for retrospective descriptive&#xD;
      evaluation of the following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor shape (smooth/rounded, irregular/lobular).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor border delineation (well-circumscribed, unclear).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor heterogeneity (homogeneous, heterogeneous).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doppler flow compared to contralateral side (decreased, equivocal, increased).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doppler flow characteristics (peripheral/circumferential, internal organized, internal&#xD;
           chaotic)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference standard: Final histopathology biopsy results will define the presence of cancer as&#xD;
      binary results (no cancer vs. cancer present). An expert head and neck pathologist will&#xD;
      re-evaluate biopsies results if inconclusive. The presence of a tumor in a correct&#xD;
      sub-location assessed by final Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) conference will be used to define&#xD;
      correct tumor location. Greatest tumor size and T-stage will also be determined by final MDT&#xD;
      decision, considering the clinical and radiological findings. For patients with available&#xD;
      complete tumor resections, a secondary analysis will be performed using the histopathologic&#xD;
      reported greatest tumor diameter as reference standard.&#xD;
