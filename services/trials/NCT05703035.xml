    <textblock>
      Complications will be evaluated by waiting 30 seconds after firing 30 seconds during stapler&#xD;
      compression while performing sleeve gastrectomy.&#xD;

      Those with a BMI between 35.0 and 39.90 and those with an obesity-related comorbidity, and&#xD;
      all morbid obesity patients with a BMI of 40.0 and above, were previously adequate for at&#xD;
      least 6 (six) months with non-surgical (diet, medication, exercise, etc.) methods. Patients&#xD;
      with morbid obesity who could not lose weight and who were unsuccessful will be included in&#xD;
      the study by signing an informed consent form for the operation and study, after being&#xD;
      evaluated by the &quot;obesity council&quot; consisting of endocrinology, psychiatry, anesthesiology,&#xD;
      dietitian and general surgery, and approved for bariatric surgery. Waiting will be made for&#xD;
      patients whose patient file number has an odd number in the last digit, and no waiting will&#xD;
      be made for patients whose last digit is an even number. At the time of the operation, the&#xD;
      patients will be put on thromboembolic stockings and the reverse trendelenburg position will&#xD;
      be given and the operation will be started with the laparoscopic method. After the stomach is&#xD;
      mobilized from the adjacent organs and structures, the 38F gastric tube will be advanced to&#xD;
      the stomach, the tissue will be closed with a 60 mm laparoscopic stapler, waited for 30&#xD;
      seconds, and then ignition will be performed. After the stapler is fired, a waiting period of&#xD;
      30 seconds will be waited and it will be removed from the tissue. In this first case, whether&#xD;
      there is bleeding or not, at how many points, whether additional intervention is required or&#xD;
      not will be recorded. At the end of the operation, the gastric tube will be withdrawn, and&#xD;
      the stomach will be filled with 120 cc saline colored with methylene blue to check if there&#xD;
      is any leakage. If there is no leakage, a gastric drainage drain will be placed and the&#xD;
      operation will be completed. Postoperative 24 - 48 . After discharge, the patient will be&#xD;
      called for routine control on the 1st week, 15th day and 30th day after discharge.&#xD;
