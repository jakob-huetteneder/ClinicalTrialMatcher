  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this two-armed cluster-randomized controlled trial is to investigate the&#xD;
      implementation of the I-PROTECT using the RE-AIM evaluation framework that addresses five&#xD;
      dimensions of effectiveness and implementation of interventions: reach, effectiveness,&#xD;
      adoption, implementation, and maintenance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 'Implementing injury Prevention training ROutines in TEams and Clubs in youth Team&#xD;
      handball (I-PROTECT)' project was initiated through dialogue between end-users and&#xD;
      researchers with the goal of making injury prevention training an integral part of regular&#xD;
      practice in youth handball through a series of studies. Numerous implementation barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators were identified in previous studies within the I-PROTECT project. These&#xD;
      determinants were addressed when designing the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study was planned with the Swedish Handball Federation, an organization with&#xD;
      overall responsibility for handball in Sweden, to investigate whether I-PROTECT will work&#xD;
      under real-world conditions and become part of regular handball practice. The specific aim is&#xD;
      to investigate the implementation of I-PROTECT using the RE-AIM evaluation framework that&#xD;
      addresses five dimensions of effectiveness and implementation of interventions: reach,&#xD;
      effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Reach (R) is the absolute number,&#xD;
      proportion and representativeness of individuals who are willing to participate in a given&#xD;
      intervention. Effectiveness (E) is the impact of the intervention on outcomes. Adoption (A)&#xD;
      is the absolute number, proportion and representativeness of settings and intervention agents&#xD;
      who are willing to use the intervention. Implementation (I) refers to the intervention&#xD;
      agents' fidelity to the various elements of the intervention's protocol. Maintenance (M) is&#xD;
      the extent to which the intervention is sustained over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design will be a pragmatic two-armed cluster-randomized controlled trial (cluster-RCT)&#xD;
      conforming to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement extension to&#xD;
      cluster-randomized trials. Eighteen randomly selected clubs in Sweden offering handball for&#xD;
      both female and male youth players, will be randomized to intervention (I-PROTECT) or control&#xD;
      (currently available injury prevention training). Implementation outcomes will be&#xD;
      investigated using RE-AIM evaluation framework, collected using a study-specific&#xD;
      questionnaire approx. 2 months and 9 months after study start.&#xD;
