  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open-label, multi-cohort, exploratory phase II clinical trial in&#xD;
      patients with either CEACAM5-positive NSQ NSCLC, ER+ breast cancer or gastric cancer.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will receive Tusamitamab ravtansine (100mg/m2 IV Q2W). The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that intratumoral exposure of Tusamitamab ravtansine would be an important factor&#xD;
      in determining treatment efficacy. Combining exposure with measurements of tumor PD reactions&#xD;
      in a proper PK/PD study is the goal of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that intratumoral exposure of Tusamitamab ravtansine would be&#xD;
      an important factor in determining treatment efficacy. The rationale to develop an&#xD;
      antibody-drug conjugate, like tusamitamab ravtansine, is that it concentrates the active&#xD;
      compound (DM4) in cancer tissues, thus confirming this hypothesis in human subjects would be&#xD;
      an important step forward. Combining exposure with measurements of tumor PD reactions in a&#xD;
      proper PK/PD study is the goal of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tusamitamab ravtansine is being developed in NSQ NSCLC. The results of the first-in-human&#xD;
      study in NSQ NSCLC patients were promising and participants could thus benefit from this&#xD;
      treatment. However, other tumor types also express CEACAM5 in tumor cells. The investigators&#xD;
      will also recruit metastatic ER+ breast cancer patients and metastatic gastric cancer&#xD;
      patients. Hence, there has been more limited data on the safety and efficacy in this patient&#xD;
      populations. Addition of these cohorts will help to understand the influence of primary tumor&#xD;
      type in determining intratumoral concentrations of Tusamitamab ravtansine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CEACAM5-positive is defined as IHC ≥2+ in intensity in ≥50% of the tumor cells expressing&#xD;
      CEACAM5. Yet, the cut-off value for CEACAM5 expression is arbitrarily selected. A PK/PD&#xD;
      relation between CEACAM5 expression and exposure would support the current applied cut-off&#xD;
      value for CEACAM5 expression.&#xD;
