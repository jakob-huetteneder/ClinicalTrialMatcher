  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shanxi Acupuncture and Moxibustion Hospital and North University of China jointly developed&#xD;
      an &quot;intelligent thunder-fire moxibustion&quot; robot with six degrees of freedom mechanical arm as&#xD;
      the core and will be applied in clinical practice to verify its clinical efficacy. In&#xD;
      clinical practice, patients with low back pain were recruited jointly by several hospitals&#xD;
      and divided into two groups. Intelligent thunder-fire moxibustion robot and artificial&#xD;
      thunder-fire moxibustion were respectively used for treatment. The clinical efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of intelligent thunder-fire moxibustion robot were evaluated through comparative&#xD;
      analysis of outcome indexes such as VAS pain scale and serum inflammatory factors.&#xD;

    <description>visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess pain. It is widely used in clinical practice in China. The basic method is to use a walking scale about 10cm long, with 10 scales on one side and &quot;0&quot; and &quot;10&quot; respectively at both ends. 0 points means no pain and 10 points means the most unbearable pain.(On a scale of 0-10, the lower the score, the better the health)</description>
