  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This work will involve conducting a randomized trial that will evaluate preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      of &quot;assisted&quot; rate cycling, voluntary rate cycling and psychotherapy for pain individually&#xD;
      and in combination as adjunctive treatments on cravings (primary outcome) in adults with an&#xD;
      opioid use disorder. The investigators will also evaluate the effects of &quot;assisted&quot; rate&#xD;
      cycling, voluntary rate cycling and I-STOP on secondary outcomes including depression,&#xD;
      anxiety and sleep.&#xD;
