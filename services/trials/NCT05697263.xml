  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The menstrual cycle implies a basic difference in the biology of women and men but the effect&#xD;
      of the hormonal variation on training protocols and physical performance is still not fully&#xD;
      understood. Despite no existing evidence, the advice to periodize exercise according to the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle has been widely spread among elite athletes, coaches, and sports federations.&#xD;
      The advice is based on underpowered studies with considerable methodological weaknesses&#xD;
      regarding determination of cycle phase, inclusion of athletes and lack of adequate control&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled study is to evaluate the effect of exercise&#xD;
      periodization on aerobic fitness during different phases of the menstrual cycle. Further, the&#xD;
      effect will be related to premenstrual symptoms, body composition and skeletal muscle&#xD;
      morphology, sex hormone receptors, metabolic enzymes, and markers of muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis. This study will be well controlled and follow methodology recommendations for&#xD;
      menstrual cycle research in sports and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female athletes of fertile age will be randomized to different training regimens during three&#xD;
      menstrual cycles (12 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Training three times a week throughout the menstrual cycle. Group B: Follicular&#xD;
      phase-based training five times a week during the follicular phase and thereafter once a week&#xD;
      during the luteal phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: Luteal phase-based training five times a week during the luteal phase and once a&#xD;
      week in the follicular phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise will consist of high intensity intermittent spinning classes. Assessment of&#xD;
      aerobic fitness and power will be performed at baseline, and again after three completed&#xD;
      menstrual cycles. On the same day, body composition will be examined by DXA and blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected for analysis of hormones and binding proteins. To confirm menstrual cycle&#xD;
      phase, blood samples will be collected for hormone determination, and urinary stick will be&#xD;
      used for detection of ovulation. Subjective ratings of menstrual cycle related symptoms will&#xD;
      be performed every day. In a subgroup of women, muscle biopsies will be collected from m&#xD;
      vastus lateralis at baseline and at the end of the study. This study will contribute to&#xD;
      improved knowledge about exercise periodization in relation to the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
      Well-grounded data is crucial to give evidence-based recommendations to female athletes when&#xD;
      planning their training protocol to optimize training results and performance.&#xD;
