  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to test the drug STAR-0215 in participants with hereditary&#xD;
      angioedema (HAE). One group of participants will get 1 dose of STAR-0215, and two other&#xD;
      groups will get 2 doses of STAR-0215. Researchers will study the effects of STAR-0215 in&#xD;
      participants with HAE as this is the first time that the drug has been given to participants&#xD;
      with HAE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2 single and multiple dose trial evaluating the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      clinical activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of subcutaneous&#xD;
      administration of STAR-0215 in participants with type I or type II HAE in 3 dose cohorts. The&#xD;
      first cohort will receive 1 dose of STAR-0215; the second and third cohorts will receive 2&#xD;
      sequential doses. This is the first trial of STAR-0215 in participants with HAE and the first&#xD;
      evaluation of a multiple-dose regimen.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Documented diagnosis of HAE (type I or II). The following must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Documented clinical history consistent with HAE (for example, subcutaneous or&#xD;
             mucosal, nonpruritic swelling episodes without accompanying urticaria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Experienced at least 2 HAE attacks during the Run-In period, as confirmed by an&#xD;
             investigator based on meeting the protocol-specified definition of an HAE attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any concomitant diagnosis of another form of chronic angioedema, such as acquired C1&#xD;
             inhibitor deficiency, HAE with normal C1-INH (also known as HAE type III), idiopathic&#xD;
             angioedema, or angioedema associated with urticaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Use of therapies prescribed for the prevention of HAE attacks prior to Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. lanadelumab within 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. berotralstat within 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. all other prophylactic therapies, within 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or any estrogen containing&#xD;
             medications with systemic absorption (such as hormonal contraceptives or hormone&#xD;
             replacement therapy) within 28 days prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any exposure to androgens (for example, stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone,&#xD;
             methyltestosterone, testosterone) within 7 days prior to Screening.&#xD;
