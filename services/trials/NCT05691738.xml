  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of modified otago exercises on joint&#xD;
      position sense, balance and physical fitness parameters in individuals with diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathy. In addition aim of to examine the effects of exercise on metabolic variables and&#xD;
      to gain exercise awareness in diabetic individuals.&#xD;

    <time_frame>a day before the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The monofilament is touched to the relevant point on the foot until it takes a C shape. Absence of a 4.17 or thicker monofilament is interpreted as being compatible with neuropathy.Failure to detect a 5.07 monofilament is considered as a loss of protective sensation.</description>

    <description>A 128 Hz tuning fork, which was oscillated before, is placed on the metatarsophalangeal joint of both feet of the individual and the patient is asked to feel the vibration. If the investigator still perceives the vibration as soon as the patient says he does not feel the vibration, it is considered neuropathy.</description>
