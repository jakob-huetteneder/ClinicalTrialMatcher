    <textblock>
      The first-in-human Phase 1 study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ADX-324 in healthy volunteers (HV) and in patients with&#xD;
      Hereditary Angioedema (HAE).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study described in this protocol is a Phase 1, single-center study evaluating&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of ADX-324.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, single ascending dose&#xD;
           (SAD) in HV with up to 6 dose cohorts. For SAD cohorts and planned dosing; and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expansion cohort in participants with Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) at selected dose from&#xD;
           Part A and will be open label.&#xD;

Randomization will be on Day 1. Initially, 2 sentinel participants (1 active and 1 placebo) will be randomized and dosed. The sentinel participants will be evaluated for safety. The investigator's assessment and the independent medical monitor will decide upon the randomization and dosing of the 6 remaining participants (5 active and 1 placebo) according to the randomization schedule.</description>
