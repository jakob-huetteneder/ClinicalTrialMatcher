  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experimental medical device is a prototype software. The device comes in the form of a&#xD;
      smartphone with a touch interface. The smartphone used to support the software is a&#xD;
      commercial smartphone marked CE. The study aims at assessing the feasibility of the use of&#xD;
      this expert, patient- decision support systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the clinical use of the experimental device is feasible.&#xD;

    <measure>Evaluate the time delay, in usual care setting, of rescue drug administrations after surgery, to confirm the interest of developing expert systems to improve the existing one.</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes after software activation</time_frame>
    <description>Delay, in minutes, between soliciting a ward nurse as usual practice (e.g., doorbell) and the administration of the therapeutic response.&#xD;
This time will be collected by the Research IDE during patient interview. 60 minutes after software activation. The patient will simultaneously request the standard care IDE (doorbell) and the INSAMED tool.</description>
