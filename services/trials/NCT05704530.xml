  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of this study is to determine the value of liquid biopsies, e.g. testing of minimal&#xD;
      residual disease (MRD) by using liquid biopsies to measure circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) at&#xD;
      diagnosis and during the multimodal and multidisciplinary curative-intent treatment of&#xD;
      resectable esophageal cancer.&#xD;

      Multicentric, retrospective and prospective components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective collection of leftover tissue from standard of care biopsies or resection&#xD;
      specimens and prospective collection of additional blood samples for study-specific analyses&#xD;
      at specific timepoints, at the same time as routine labs are foreseen. No additional&#xD;
      venipunctures are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three distinct patient groups are defined, depending on the therapeutic scenario patients&#xD;
      undertake:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scenario 1: primary resection then follow-up - Study-specific liquid biopsies will be&#xD;
      collected in 98 patients, at the time of routine labs. Samples will be acquired before&#xD;
      resection, at 6-8 weeks, 6 and 12 months after resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scenario 2: chemoradiation followed by resection and follow-up - Study-specific liquid&#xD;
      biopsies will be collected in 50 patients. Samples will be acquired before the start of&#xD;
      chemoradiation, before surgery, 6-8 weeks, 6 and 12 months after surgery. A subgroup of&#xD;
      patients will undertake adjuvant immunotherapy and will constitute Group 3. Timing of&#xD;
      sampling will be adjusted accordingly as per study flowcharts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scenario 3: chemoradiation followed by resection followed by adjuvant immunotherapy -&#xD;
      Study-specific liquid biopsies will be collected in 100 patients. Samples will be acquired&#xD;
      before the start of chemoradiation, before surgery, 6-8 weeks after surgery and during&#xD;
      adjuvant immunotherapy every 3 months including a sample at the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient management is standard of care. No investigational medicinal product (IMP) is&#xD;
      involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific clinicopathological variables will be collected in a RedCap electronic Case Report&#xD;
      Form and analysed as per statistical analysis plan.&#xD;
