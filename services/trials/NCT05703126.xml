    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal neoplastic disease of the hematopoietic tissue&#xD;
      associated with a mutation in the precursor cell of hematopoiesis, which results in a&#xD;
      differentiation block and uncontrolled proliferation of immature myeloid cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthracycline antibiotics have been an integral part of the treatment of acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia since the 1970s. However, the clinical usefulness of anthracyclines is limited&#xD;
      primarily by the high incidence of cardiotoxicity. According to the European Society of&#xD;
      Cardiology guidelines for cardio-oncology, cardiovascular toxicity is defined as any&#xD;
      impairment of cardiac function associated with anticancer treatment, as the term encompasses&#xD;
      both a wide range of possible clinical manifestations and an etiological relationship with&#xD;
      various treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy and treatment&#xD;
      with targeted drugs. Cardiovascular toxicity can be acute, subacute or delayed, manifesting&#xD;
      many years after chemotherapy or radiation therapy, involving a number of cardiac structures,&#xD;
      which can lead to the development of heart failure, coronary heart disease, valvular heart&#xD;
      disease, arrhythmias, including cardiac conduction disorders and diseases of the pericardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is the negative effect of anthracyclines on normal&#xD;
      cardiac activity due to their toxic effects on the heart muscle and the cardiac conduction&#xD;
      system. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity manifests as asymptomatic left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction in 57% of treated patients and restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy leading to&#xD;
      congestive heart failure (CHF) in 16% to 20% of patients. Anthracycline-induced congestive&#xD;
      heart failure is often resistant to therapy and has a mortality rate of up to 79%. Thus,&#xD;
      there is a need for early detection of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in order to timely prescribe drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study To optimize the early detection of endothelial dysfunction and left&#xD;
      ventricular myocardial contractility in patients with acute myeloid leukemia during&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment based on a comprehensive assessment of instrumental and laboratory&#xD;
      research parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results Based on a comprehensive analysis using laser Doppler flowmetry, stress&#xD;
      echocardiography with the determination of global longitudinal strain of the myocardium,&#xD;
      biochemical markers of endothelial damage and cardiac biomarkers, a correlation between&#xD;
      violations of the contractility of the left ventricular myocardium and violations of the&#xD;
      vasoregulatory function of the vascular endothelium will be revealed, which will allow&#xD;
      developing an algorithm for early detection of cardiomyopathy and vascular complications in&#xD;
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia during chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal neoplastic disease of the hematopoietic tissue&#xD;
      associated with a mutation in the precursor cell of hematopoiesis, which results in a&#xD;
      differentiation block and uncontrolled proliferation of immature myeloid cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that AML affects an average of 3-5 people per 100,000 people per year. At the&#xD;
      same time, the incidence increases sharply at the age of over 60 years and amounts to 12-13&#xD;
      cases per 100 thousand of the population in people over the age of 80 years. The median age&#xD;
      of this disease is 65 years. With a population of 140 million inhabitants in Russia, the&#xD;
      estimated incidence rate (according to European and American researchers) should be about 5&#xD;
      thousand cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthracycline antibiotics have been an integral part of the treatment of acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia since the 1970s. Anthracycline is usually given for 3 days (eg, daunorubicin 45-90&#xD;
      mg/m 2 daily, idarubicin 12 mg/m 2 daily) in combination with cytarabine (100-200 mg/m 2&#xD;
      daily) continuously for 7 days ) (&quot;7+3&quot; mode). Anthracyclines block the synthesis of DNA and&#xD;
      RNA by inhibiting the enzyme topoisomerase IIÎ² and mitochondrial topoisomerase I. The&#xD;
      subsequent disruption of DNA replication and transcription prevents the proliferation of&#xD;
      rapidly dividing cells. In addition, anthracyclines damage DNA, proteins, and cell membranes&#xD;
      by creating free oxygen radicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical usefulness of anthracyclines is limited primarily by the high incidence of&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity. According to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines for cardio-&#xD;
      oncology, cardiovascular toxicity is defined as any impairment of cardiac function associated&#xD;
      with anticancer treatment, as the term encompasses both a wide range of possible clinical&#xD;
      manifestations and an etiological relationship with various treatments, including&#xD;
      chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy and treatment with targeted drugs.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular toxicity can be acute, subacute or delayed, manifesting many years after&#xD;
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy, involving a number of cardiac structures, which can lead&#xD;
      to the development of heart failure, coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease,&#xD;
      arrhythmias, including cardiac conduction disorders, and diseases of the pericardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is the negative effect of anthracyclines on normal&#xD;
      cardiac activity due to their toxic effects on the heart muscle and the cardiac conduction&#xD;
      system. It is believed to be mediated in part by reactive oxygen species generated by&#xD;
      anthracycline treatment, which leads to lipid peroxidation and DNA damage in cardiomyocytes.&#xD;
      Other putative causes of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity include accumulation of&#xD;
      cardiotoxic anthracycline metabolites in the heart, disruption of calcium homeostasis,&#xD;
      mitochondrial damage, and induction of apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity manifests as asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction&#xD;
      in 57% of treated patients and restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy leading to congestive&#xD;
      heart failure (CHF) in 16% to 20% of patients. Anthracycline-induced congestive heart failure&#xD;
      is often resistant to therapy and has a mortality rate of up to 79%. Thus, there is a need&#xD;
      for early detection of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with chemotherapy treatment of&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia in order to timely prescribe drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study To optimize the early detection of endothelial dysfunction and left&#xD;
      ventricular myocardial contractility in patients with acute myeloid leukemia during&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment based on a comprehensive assessment of instrumental and laboratory&#xD;
      research parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the state of endothelial function in patients with acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
           receiving chemotherapy based on a comprehensive assessment, including laser Doppler&#xD;
           flowmetry and biochemical markers of endothelial damage (endothelin-1, asymmetric&#xD;
           dimethylarginine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the contractility of the left ventricular myocardium in patients with&#xD;
           acute myeloid leukemia during chemotherapeutic treatment based on the indicators of&#xD;
           stress echocardiography with the determination of global longitudinal deformation of the&#xD;
           myocardium, as well as to assess the presence of myocardial damage by determining the&#xD;
           level of highly sensitive troponin and brain natriuretic peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the relationship between dynamic indicators of microcirculation, determined by&#xD;
           laser Doppler flowmetry, with indicators of contractility of the left ventricular&#xD;
           myocardium, detected using stress echocardiography with the determination of global&#xD;
           longitudinal deformation of the myocardium, and the results of laboratory methods for&#xD;
           assessing the function of the endothelium and myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the frequency of development of various phenotypes of cardiovascular&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To identify the most significant prognostic criteria for the development of&#xD;
           cardiotoxicity in patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific novelty&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For the first time, an algorithm for early detection of endothelial dysfunction and left&#xD;
           ventricular myocardial contractility in patients with acute myeloid leukemia during&#xD;
           chemotherapy treatment will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For the first time, the vasoregulatory function of the endothelium and the contractility&#xD;
           of the left ventricular myocardium in patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving&#xD;
           chemotherapy will be studied based on a comprehensive assessment using laser Doppler&#xD;
           flowmetry, stress echocardiography with the determination of global longitudinal&#xD;
           deformation of the myocardium, biochemical markers of endothelial damage and cardiac&#xD;
           biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical significance It is planned to develop an algorithm for early detection of&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and left ventricular myocardial contractility in patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia during chemotherapy treatment based on a comprehensive assessment using&#xD;
      laser Doppler flowmetry, stress echocardiography with the determination of global&#xD;
      longitudinal myocardial strain, biochemical markers of endothelial damage and cardiac&#xD;
      biomarkers. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results Based on a comprehensive analysis using laser Doppler flowmetry, stress&#xD;
      echocardiography with the determination of global longitudinal strain of the myocardium,&#xD;
      biochemical markers of endothelial damage and cardiac biomarkers, a correlation between&#xD;
      violations of the contractility of the left ventricular myocardium and violations of the&#xD;
      vasoregulatory function of the vascular endothelium will be revealed, which will allow&#xD;
      developing an algorithm for early detection of cardiomyopathy and vascular complications in&#xD;
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia during chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed algorithm for the early detection of cardiovascular complications in patients&#xD;
      with acute myeloid leukemia receiving chemotherapy treatment is an effective method for&#xD;
      diagnosing cardiovascular complications at subclinical stages for the timely initiation of&#xD;
      their therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design In total, it is planned to study 100 patients with acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy, aged 18 to 65 years, without clinical signs of heart failure, with an&#xD;
      LV ejection fraction of more than 50% before the start of polychemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group will include patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving chemotherapy,&#xD;
      aged 18 to 65 years, without clinical signs of heart failure, with an LV ejection fraction of&#xD;
      more than 50% before the start of polychemotherapy, in whom in the course of chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment after the next course of treatment a decrease in global longitudinal strain of 15%&#xD;
      or more relative to the initial values will be revealed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will consist of patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy, aged 18 to 65 years, without clinical signs of heart failure, with an LV&#xD;
      ejection fraction of more than 50% before the start of polychemotherapy, in whom no signs of&#xD;
      myocardial disease and endothelial dysfunction will be detected during chemotherapy.&#xD;
