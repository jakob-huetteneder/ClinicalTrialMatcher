  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to tests the effect of incentivizing achievement of&#xD;
      self-identified, personal harm reduction goals (Contingency management or CM) compared with&#xD;
      standard of care (peer harm reduction service with incentives for peer visits) to increase&#xD;
      the reach and effectiveness of methamphetamine (MA) harm reduction services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation framework and stepped-wedge design, this&#xD;
      study will randomize eighteen community-based peer harm reduction sites to provide&#xD;
      contingency management incentives for achieving self-identified harm reduction goals set with&#xD;
      peer specialists using a participant-driven harm reduction goal-setting process (e.g.&#xD;
      completing overdose prevention and supply training, daily life goals, treatment and care&#xD;
      goals, relationship and social support goals) versus standard of care contingency management&#xD;
      (i.e. incentives for peer encounter attendance).&#xD;
