      Relaxation techniques are a non-pharmacological therapy option applied to alleviate the&#xD;
      symptoms of many different chronic diseases. It has been reported in the literature that PMR&#xD;
      is effective on pain, fatigue and stress symptoms in fibromyalgia patients. No study has been&#xD;
      found examining the effect of PMR on kinesiophobia and functional status in FM. This study&#xD;
      was planned to examine the effect of progressive muscle relaxation exercises on pain,&#xD;
      kinesiophobia and functional status in fibromyalgia patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM), which is a chronic pain disorder, is a difficult disease to treat, and it&#xD;
      is stated that a multidisciplinary approach is required in its treatment rather than a single&#xD;
      treatment method. Approaches that consider optimal symptom management and functional status&#xD;
      in treatment, include non-pharmacological methods in addition to pharmacological treatment,&#xD;
      and include psychosocial and behavioral methods are recommended. Non-pharmacological methods&#xD;
      that have proven their effectiveness in FM treatment include aerobic exercise, patient&#xD;
      education, cognitive therapies, balneotherapy, and physical therapy agents. One of the&#xD;
      methods that can be applied in patients with FM is progressive muscle relaxation (PMR)&#xD;
      exercises. PMR is an easy, low-cost, and side-effect-free relaxation technique. PMR helps&#xD;
      individuals feel calmer and more relaxed through sequential muscle tension and relaxation. It&#xD;
      has been reported in the literature that PMR is effective on pain, fatigue and stress&#xD;
      symptoms in fibromyalgia patients. No study has been found examining the effect of PMR on&#xD;
      kinesiophobia and functional status in FM. Therefore, this study was planned to examine the&#xD;
      effect of progressive muscle relaxation exercises on pain, kinesiophobia and functional&#xD;
      status in fibromyalgia patients.&#xD;

    <description>Experimental group Fibromyalgia patients will be provided with progressive relaxation exercises twice a week. Progressive relaxation technique includes stretching and relaxing the bigmuscle groups (hands, arms, neck, shoulders, face, chest, abdomen,hip, feet andfingers) in the human body on purpose. When steps ofProgressive Relaxation Exercises are analyzed, it is observed thatlearning how to take correct and deep breaths is the most impor-tant step towards learning relaxation.</description>
