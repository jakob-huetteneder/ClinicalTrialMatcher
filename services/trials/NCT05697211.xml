    <description>KCCQ = Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire&#xD;
The KCCQ 12 is a health-related quality of life questionnaire to measure the disease-specific health status of patients with heart failure. It is a 12 item questionnaire that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge and quality of life. Scores are generated for each domain and scaled from 0 to 100, with 0 denoting the lowest reportable health status and 100 the highest reportable health status.</description>
