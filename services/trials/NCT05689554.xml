      The overall objective of STOP-FALLS is to test whether a patient-centered deprescribing&#xD;
      intervention that focuses on CNS-active medications reduces medically treated falls among&#xD;
      older adults. Our aims are: AIM 1: Adapt and pilot-test an evidence-based medication&#xD;
      reduction intervention for use in an integrated health care system. AIM 2: Implement and&#xD;
      evaluate the adapted intervention using a cluster-randomized controlled trial design. Aim 3:&#xD;
      Assess barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation.&#xD;

      Background: Central nervous system (CNS) active medications have been consistently linked to&#xD;
      falls in older people. However, few randomized trials have evaluated whether CNS-active&#xD;
      medication reduction reduces falls and fall-related injuries. The objective of the Reducing&#xD;
      CNS-active Medications to Prevent Falls and Injuries in Older Adults (STOP-FALLS) trial is to&#xD;
      test the effectiveness of a health-system-embedded deprescribing intervention focused on&#xD;
      CNS-active medications on the incidence of medically treated falls among community-dwelling&#xD;
      older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, parallel-group, controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      within Kaiser Permanente Washington to test the effectiveness of a 12-month deprescribing&#xD;
      intervention consisting of: 1) an educational brochure and self-care handouts mailed to older&#xD;
      adults prescribed one or more CNS-active medications (aged 60+: opioids, benzodiazepines and&#xD;
      Z-drugs; aged 65+: skeletal muscle relaxants, tricyclic antidepressants, and antihistamines)&#xD;
      and 2) decision support for their primary health care providers. Outcomes are examined over&#xD;
      18-26 months post-intervention. The primary outcome is first incident (post-baseline)&#xD;
      medically treated fall as determined from health plan data. Our sample size calculations&#xD;
      ensured at least 80% power to detect a 20% reduction in the rate of medically treated falls&#xD;
      for participants receiving care within the intervention (n=9) versus usual care clinics (n=9)&#xD;
      assuming 18 months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes include medication discontinuation or&#xD;
      dose reduction of any target medications. Safety outcomes include serious adverse drug&#xD;
      withdrawal events, unintentional overdose, and death. We will also examine medication&#xD;
      signetur fields for attempts to decrease medications. We will report factors affecting&#xD;
      implementation of the intervention.&#xD;

    <description>This is a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, parallel-group, controlled clinical trial. The unit of randomization is the clinic, to avoid the risk of contamination if healthcare providers within a clinic were randomized (i.e., reducing the potential for intervention providers to communicate with control providers about the intervention and share materials). Eighteen clinics were identified for the trial, of which 9 were randomized to the intervention and 9 to usual care.</description>
