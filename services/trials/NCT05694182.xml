    <description>Skin wrinkles will be assessed using JANUS III skin analyzer and Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS). For WSRS, dermatologists will evaluate participants' wrinkles based on 5-point photonumeric rating scale that will objectively evaluate the severity of crow's feet at rest (static) and with a smiling expression (dynamic). The scale scores are 0 for no wrinkles, 1 for very fine wrinkles, 2 for fine wrinkles, 3 for moderate wrinkles, and 4 for severe wrinkles.</description>
