  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extended-release buprenorphine (SUBLOCADE®) injection is currently approved for subcutaneous&#xD;
      administration in 4 different quadrants of the abdomen for treatment of opioid use disorder&#xD;
      (OUD). Injection locations are rotated to minimize irritation. Having 1 or more alternate&#xD;
      injection sites is desirable for patients who may be taking SUBLOCADE for extended durations,&#xD;
      based upon clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the relative bioavailability of&#xD;
      extended-release buprenorphine when administered at alternative injection locations (test&#xD;
      treatments), in comparison to the abdomen (reference treatment).&#xD;
