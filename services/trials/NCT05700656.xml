    <textblock>
      This is a two-center pharmacological open-label non-randomized proof of principle study&#xD;
      consisting of two parts: a phase I study evaluating the RP2D of galunisertib in combination&#xD;
      with capecitabine; and a phase II study investigating the anti-tumor activity and safety of&#xD;
      galunisertib in combination with capecitabine in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) with&#xD;
      peritoneal metastases (PM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase II of the study a Simon two-stage design will be used. 15 patients will be treated&#xD;
      with the galunisertib/capecitabine combination. If at least 2 out of 15 patients respond, an&#xD;
      additional cohort of 10 patients will be included to a total of 25 patients. With 6 or more&#xD;
      responses, the treatment will be declared to be of sufficient activity and with 5 or less it&#xD;
      will be declared of insufficient activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The galunisertib dose will be 150 mg twice daily (BID) for the first 14 days of every 4-week&#xD;
      cycle, which is the maximum tolerated dose when given as single agent (except of day 1 of&#xD;
      cycle 1: single dose of galunisertib 150 mg for PK analysis, from day 2: 150 mg BID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine will be dosed during every 14-day on time of galunisertib at 1000 mg/m2 BID,&#xD;
      which is the labelled dose as monotherapy and will in case of toxicities be reduced according&#xD;
      to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessments will be performed routinely to monitor safety. Anti-tumor activity will&#xD;
      be measured by CT scan according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Tumor biopsies will be obtained for&#xD;
      exploratory objectives.&#xD;
