    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a the most common type of dementia. It is a progressive disease&#xD;
      that affects different areas of human behavior at the cognitive, social, physical and&#xD;
      metabolic levels. The benefits of a High-Intensity Interval Exercise Program (HIIT) has been&#xD;
      proven not only in healthy older adults, but also in different pathologies, such as&#xD;
      cerebrovascular and cardiometabolic diseases. However, there are no studies to date that&#xD;
      examine the impact of HIIT in people with AD. The aim of this study was to ascertain the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a HIIT program versus a cognitive and motor dual task balance program on&#xD;
      parameters related to functional capacity and cognitive function in people with AD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a the most common type of dementia. It is a progressive disease&#xD;
      that affects different areas of human behavior at the cognitive, social, physical and&#xD;
      metabolic levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of interventions such as dual-task training (TD) have been the focus of studies&#xD;
      in recent years in AD. Current evidence shows that DT training leads to improvements in&#xD;
      parameters related to frontal cognitive function, such as: planning, organization, strategy&#xD;
      creation, abstraction, motor sequencing, working memory, thinking flexibility, visual search,&#xD;
      sequencing, sustained attention and working memory. DT training has been also shown to&#xD;
      improve variables related to gait ability and balance, such as step length and gait speed,&#xD;
      postural control and specific functional tasks under challenging conditions of double task.&#xD;
      However, AD is also associated with reduced cardiovascular fitness and decreased muscle&#xD;
      strength, thus leading to a loss of independence in activities of daily living and poor&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising intervention to address these issues is high-intensity interval exercise (HIIT),&#xD;
      defined as brief intermittent bursts of vigorous activity interspersed with periods of rest&#xD;
      or low-intensity exercise. Indeed, it has been reported that HIIT generates greater benefits&#xD;
      in cardiorespiratory capacity and greater metabolic adaptations than continuous exercise of&#xD;
      moderate intensity in healthy older adults. HIIT interventions have resulted in benefits on&#xD;
      variables related to functional capacity, such as improved gait speed, increased muscle mass&#xD;
      and strength. Furthermore, HIIT has been shown to improve variables related to cognitive&#xD;
      function, such as attention, perception and memory abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are no studies to date that examine the impact of HIIT in people with AD. The&#xD;
      aim of this study was to ascertain the effectiveness of a HIIT program versus a cognitive and&#xD;
      motor dual task balance program on parameters related to functional capacity and cognitive&#xD;
      function in people with AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a randomized clinical trial will be carried out, in which three groups of twenty&#xD;
      people in each group will participate, with different interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group 1: HIIT (HIIT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group 2: Dual task training (DT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: No intervention (CG) Participants will be evaluated in three moments, at&#xD;
           baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2) and at 2 month-follow-up (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be performed with SPSS statistic program (v26). Normality and&#xD;
      homoscedasticity will be analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk t-test and Levene test, respectively. For&#xD;
      comparation between groups Bonferroni will be used. If any confusion factor that not meet&#xD;
      requirements to be analysed like a covariable exist, ANCOVA will be used. When p&lt;0.0.5&#xD;
      statistical significant differences will be assumed.&#xD;
