  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate evidence-based treatments for adults with mild Primary Progressive&#xD;
      Aphasia (PPA). The aim of the study is to help identify efficacious communication and quality&#xD;
      of life interventions for those with PPA and their care-partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be&#xD;
      involved in the study for 12 months. Each participant will receive a iPad equipped with the&#xD;
      necessary applications and features for the study. Participants will complete evaluations,&#xD;
      speech therapy sessions with a speech and language therapist, and sessions with a licensed&#xD;
      social worker or related clinician. They will have access to Communication Bridge, a&#xD;
      personalized web application to practice home exercises that reinforce treatment strategies.&#xD;
      There are no costs to participate in this study.&#xD;

    <description>Participants receive Communication Bridge™, a multi-component, participation-focused, dyadic intervention in which both the person with PPA and their co-enrolled communication partner are intervention recipients. Communication Bridge™ is modelled on the Living with Aphasia: Framework for Outcome Measurement (A-FROM) and the Care Pathway Model that was developed for persons living with primary progressive aphasia. Consistent with participation-focused intervention models personally salient training stimuli are incorporated into all therapy activities in the Experimental arm.</description>

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
