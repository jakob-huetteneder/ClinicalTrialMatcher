    <textblock>
      This project will test whether a healthy lifestyle intervention, specifically designed for&#xD;
      adults with posttraumatic stress and identified cardiovascular risks, is effective in&#xD;
      improving cardiovascular health. Therefore, this study will provide information needed to&#xD;
      evaluate the potential benefits of cognitive-behavioral lifestyle interventions for&#xD;
      addressing barriers to healthy behavior in this at-risk population and reducing risks for&#xD;
      heart disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considerable research has indicated strong associations between posttraumatic stress and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) tend&#xD;
      to show patterns of elevated CVD risk earlier in life than in the general population. The&#xD;
      need for developing effective interventions for CVD risk-reduction in PTSD is increasingly&#xD;
      evident. In comparison to the cumulative evidence concerning elevated CVD risk in PTSD,&#xD;
      relatively little research has addressed CVD risk-reduction in this population. Adjunctive&#xD;
      treatments, such as health behavior interventions, may be necessary as supplements to&#xD;
      traditional psychotherapy for PTSD in order to reduce CVD risks. The objective of the&#xD;
      proposed project is to examine the effects of a healthy lifestyle intervention that addresses&#xD;
      multiple CVD-related heath behaviors among civilian adults across genders (ages 18+), who&#xD;
      evidence PTSD and CVD risk at baseline. The investigators will assess the intervention impact&#xD;
      on both subjective and objective indices of health behaviors, cardiovascular risks and CVD&#xD;
      markers over a one-year timeframe. The healthy lifestyle intervention addresses unique&#xD;
      aspects of PTSD symptom presentation that serve as barriers to healthy behaviors (e.g.,&#xD;
      nightmares/sleep disruption, and cognitive responses to stress), while encouraging healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle changes. The primary goal of the present study is to examine whether, compared to a&#xD;
      usual care psychotherapy control condition, utilizing the healthy lifestyle intervention as&#xD;
      an adjunct to psychotherapy will result in significantly reduced CVD risks and improved CVD&#xD;
      markers among civilian adults with PTSD and elevated CVD risks. Therefore, participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either a usual care psychotherapy-only control condition or a usual&#xD;
      care psychotherapy plus healthy lifestyle intervention condition. Outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      at post-intervention (12 weeks), as well as 6-month and 12-month time points for follow-up&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This intervention study will examine the effects of a 12-session healthy lifestyle program (focused on physical activity, nutrition, sleep, and stress management) administered in an individual format as an adjunct to usual care psychotherapy, compared with a usual care psychotherapy-only control condition. The control group will only attend the outcome assessments and usual care psychotherapy sessions. Therefore, the design relies on a between-groups comparison of the two conditions.</intervention_model_description>
