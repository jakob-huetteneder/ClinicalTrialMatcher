      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of EBC-129 as a single agent and in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumours&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open label study which is divided into 3 parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will be dose escalation segment to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of EBC-129 monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B will be dose escalation segment to identify the MTD and RP2D of EBC-129 in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C (dose expansion cohort) will be performed in an expanded cohort of subjects with&#xD;
      advanced solid malignancies at the RP2D of EBC-129 as a monotherapy identified in the dose&#xD;
      escalation segment, Part A.&#xD;
