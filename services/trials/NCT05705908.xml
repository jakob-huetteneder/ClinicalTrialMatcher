  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common problems in patients in the postoperative period is pain and the&#xD;
      associated deterioration in sleep quality. Deterioration in sleep quality can cause pain to&#xD;
      be perceived more severely. It is recommended to use non-pharmacological approaches as well&#xD;
      as pharmacological interventions in the management of these problems. This study was planned&#xD;
      to determine the effect of hot foot bath and lavender essential oil foot bath application on&#xD;
      postoperative sleep quality and pain in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It was planned as a randomized controlled trial. The population of the study consisted of&#xD;
      patients who underwent abdominal surgery in the General Surgery Service of a private health&#xD;
      group hospital in Istanbul. Patients who met the inclusion criteria constituted the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Visual Comparison Scale-VAS&quot; and &quot;Richard-Campbell Sleep Scale&quot; were used during data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Comparison Scale-VAS: It is a scale that starts with no pain and ends with unbearable.&#xD;
      The VAS scale consists of a 10 cm long line. At one end of the line, &quot;no pain&quot; signals what&#xD;
      may be at the other end of the &quot;unbearable pain.&quot; The patient is asked to point to a point&#xD;
      that indicates the current level of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Richard-Campbell Sleep Scale: This scale consists of 6 items that evaluate the depth of night&#xD;
      sleep, the time to fall asleep, the frequency of awakening, the time to stay awake when&#xD;
      awakened, the quality of sleep and the noise level of the environment. Each item is evaluated&#xD;
      on a chart between 0 and 100 using the visual analog scale technique. According to the scale,&#xD;
      the score in the range of &quot;0-25&quot; indicates very bad sleep, and the score in the range of&#xD;
      &quot;76-100&quot; indicates very good sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foot bath was started as of the 24th hour after the operation. During the 3 days they were&#xD;
      hospitalized, they had a foot bath evening before going to sleep (experimental group).&#xD;
      Routine service applications were performed in the control group. In order to ensure the&#xD;
      comfort of the experimental and control group patients and to minimize their exposure to the&#xD;
      external environment, the patient rooms were kept clean, at a suitable temperature (23-25&#xD;
      degrees) and quiet.&#xD;
