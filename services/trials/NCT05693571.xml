  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational and pilot study is to better understand how depression&#xD;
      symptoms may contribute to how well adolescent and young adults with lupus follow-up with&#xD;
      their lupus clinical care. The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether anhedonia (a core symptom of depression) predicts disengagement in care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether a patient-tailored mobile health application built to improve both engagement in&#xD;
           care and depression symptoms will be feasible and acceptable to adolescents and young&#xD;
           adults with lupus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with systemic lupus, ages 15-24 from the Bronx, New York will be asked to&#xD;
      complete questionnaires; some will be asked to participate in focus groups to help adapt the&#xD;
      mobile health app; participants will also be invited to join a pilot study to try the mobile&#xD;
      health app for 6 months and answer questionnaires to document the experience.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of the Valera health application will determined by the percentage of participants who utilize the Valera platform. Participants with repeated (i.e., &gt;2) log-ins to both the care management and educational platforms will be considered users. A successful target percentage of â‰¥ 80% of enrolled participants logging into the care plan on the application and utilizing the messenger system at least twice during the 6-month pilot will be considered highly feasible.</description>

    <measure>Feasibility of the Intervention Measure (Participant Rating of Application Feasibility)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of the Intervention Measure (FIM) will be assessed by administration of a 4-item questionnaire at the end of the pilot study. Responses to each of the 4 questions will be evaluated on a 5-point scale Response (1 = Completely disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neither agree nor disagree, 4 = Agree, 5 = Completely agree). A higher aggregate score denotes a more favorable participant rating of feasibility of the application.</description>

    <description>Acceptability of the Intervention Measure (AIM) will be assessed by administration of a 4-item questionnaire at the end of the pilot study. Responses to each of the 4 questions will be evaluated on a 5-point scale Response (1 = Completely disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neither agree nor disagree, 4 = Agree, 5 = Completely agree). A higher aggregate score denotes a more favorable participant rating of the application.</description>

    <description>Engagement in Care will be defined by the number of participants who have completed at least 1 clinical cSLE visit during the 6-month pilot window.</description>

    <measure>SLE disease activity - patient reported</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported cSLE disease activity as defined by the SLE Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ). The SLAQ is a binary assessment tool which asks a single Patient Global Assessment question about presence and severity of lupus activity; questions on 24 specific symptoms of disease activity; and a single Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) asking the patient to rate disease activity on a scale of 0 - 10 (0 = 'no activity' and 10 = 'most activity'). Likert responses with four response categories (no problem, mild, moderate, and severe) are used for the single Patient Global Assessment as well as the 24 specific symptom questions. A higher composite score indicates increased lupus disease activity.</description>

    <measure>SLE disease activity - clinically assessed, 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically assessed lupus disease activity defined by SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI 2K). SLEDAI-2K is a binary scoring system based on the presence of 24 descriptors in nine organ systems assessed over the preceding 30 days. Descriptors of SLEDAI-2K are documented as either present or absent. Each of the descriptors has a weighted score and the total score of SLEDAI-2K is the sum of all 24 descriptor scores.</description>

This questionnaire consists of a 21-item self reporting inventory answered by the participant based on a 4-point scale of increased severity of depression symptoms over the period. The results are totaled and a higher composite score is used as an indicator of increased severity of depression symptoms.</description>
