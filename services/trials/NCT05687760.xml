      After diagnosing the case as pulp necrosis and confirming that the patient conforms to all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, the operator will enroll the patient in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of all cases will be completed in two visits as follows :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anesthetizing the tooth using mental nerve block technique by local anesthesia of 1.8 ml&#xD;
           of 2% Mepivacaine HCl with 1:100,000 epinephrine (Artinibsa®; Inibsa Dental, Lliçà de&#xD;
           Vall,Spain) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Removal of Caries and/or coronal restorations completely with sterile bur and rubber dam&#xD;
           will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cleaning the operative field, including the tooth, the clamp, and rubber dam sheet, with&#xD;
           3% hydrogen peroxide until no further bubbling of the peroxide occurred. All surfaces&#xD;
           will then be disinfected by a sterile cotton swab with a 5.25% sodium hypochlorite&#xD;
           solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Preparation of access cavity using another sterile round carbide bur size 3 and Endo-z&#xD;
           bur (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After completing the access, the operative field and the pulp chamber will be cleaned&#xD;
           and disinfected once again in the same way mentioned above. NaOCl will be then&#xD;
           neutralized with 5% sodium thiosulfate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The pre-instrumentation root canal sample (S0) will be taken as follows: a sterile paper&#xD;
           point will be placed in the canal to soak up the fluid in the canal to a level&#xD;
           approximately 1 mm short of the tooth apex based on diagnostic radiographs and estimated&#xD;
           working length. The paper point will be left in the canal for at least 1 minute. Paper&#xD;
           points will then be transferred aseptically to tubes containing sterile brain heart&#xD;
           infusion (BHI) broth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Confirming the patency of the root canals using stainless steel hand K-files size #10&#xD;
           and #15(K-Files, MANI, INC., Industrial Park, Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan) Working length&#xD;
           will be determined using an electronic apex locator(Root ZX, J. Morita USA, Irvine, CA)&#xD;
           then confirmed radiographically to be 1 mm shorter than radiographic apex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Mechanical preparation will be done using M PRO rotary files in an endodontic motor&#xD;
           (X-Smart, Dentsply Maillefer, USA) The first file (18/.09) will be used as an orifice&#xD;
           opener for two thirds of the working length followed by (20/.04) and (25/.06) for the&#xD;
           full working length and finally (35/.04). In-and-out motions will be applied with stroke&#xD;
           lengths not exceeding 3 mm in the cervical, middle, and apical thirds until attaining&#xD;
           the established WL. The first file is used with a continuous rotary motion at a speed of&#xD;
           500rpm and torque of 3Ncm. The second, third and fourth files are used with a speed of&#xD;
           300 rpm and torque of 1.5Ncm. The canal will be irrigated and recapitulated after the&#xD;
           use of each instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The canal will be thoroughly irrigated with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite root canal irrigant&#xD;
           (5ml for 1 min) using disposable plastic syringe with side vented needle gauge 30 (Steri&#xD;
           irrigation tips; Diadent, Chungcheongbuk-do, Korea) reaching 1 mm short of the working&#xD;
           length. All teeth will receive the same volume of irrigant (5 ml prior to&#xD;
           instrumentation, 5 ml between each file and 5 ml as final flush after root canal&#xD;
           instrumentation to reach a total volume of 25 ml in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Post-instrumentation sample (S1) will be taken as previously mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. The patients will then be assigned into two groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the intervention groups, Bromelain paste (Bromelain powder with enzymatic activity of&#xD;
           2400 Gelatin digestion unit per Gram was mixed with saline in 1:1 proportion 1 g powder&#xD;
           was mixed with 1 ml distilled water) will be placed inside the canals using sterile&#xD;
           plastic syringe with needle gauge 27 without binding 1mm shorter than working length .&#xD;
           The access cavities were closed using sterile cotton pellet and intermediate restorative&#xD;
           material .&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the control group, Ca(OH)29will be placed inside the canals using sterile plastic&#xD;
           syringe with needle gauge 27 without binding 1 mm shorter than working length .The&#xD;
           access cavities were closed using sterile cotton pellet and intermediate restorative&#xD;
           material .&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Patients will be asked to record their pain level after the first visit on Numeric&#xD;
           Rating Scale (NRS) at 6, 12, 24, 48 hours.(Appendix V)&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Each patient will be given a chart to record postoperative swelling. If swelling was&#xD;
           recorded, the patient will be appointed for clinical examination to assess the severity&#xD;
           by blinded assessor in a swelling rating scale and to determine if systemic antibiotics&#xD;
           (Augmentin 625mg/8 hours/5 days) or drainage would have been needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. In the recall appointment after 1 week. Rubber dam will be applied then intracanal&#xD;
           medication will be removed using copious irrigation and fanta AF max rotary file (#25&#xD;
           0.04) and tooth will be disinfected as before. The previously sampled canal will be&#xD;
           re-entered, flushed with copious saline irrigation and a third sample (S-2) will be&#xD;
           taken. After the sampling, final flush with 2.5% NaOCL and 17% EDTA will be done in both&#xD;
           groups. Master cones of (0.40) taper gutta-percha(Meta Biomed Co., Ltd, Korea) will be&#xD;
           fitted to the working length and a radiograph will be taken to ensure proper length.&#xD;
           Obturation will be done by modified single cone technique using epoxy resin&#xD;
           sealer(Adseal, Meta Biomed CO.,LTD, Korea)and 4% taper gutta percha cones together with&#xD;
           auxillary cones.&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. The tooth will be sealed by temporary restoration ,Then the details of the endodontic&#xD;
           procedure for each patient will be recorded in the patient's procedure chart (Appendix&#xD;
           IV) .&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. The patient will be instructed to return to complete the treatment procedures until&#xD;
           placing a full-coverage restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. In case of severe pain or persisting pain patients are instructed to take prescribed&#xD;
           analgesic (Ibuprofen 400mg), not to take it less than 6 hours apart&#xD;
