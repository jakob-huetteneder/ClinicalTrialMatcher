      This is a prospective randomized parallel two group pharmacist-led interventional study. The&#xD;
      study will involve introduction of the mobile game to pediatric diabetic patients to improve&#xD;
      their blood glucose level. The outcomes to be measured are diabetes control and behavioral&#xD;
      change in pediatric patients with type1 diabetes mellitus&#xD;

    <description>Control group will be provided with usual care. Intervention group will be provided in addition to the usual care, an access to the mobile game after a simple training for game usage. Both groups will be followed for a period of 3 months.&#xD;
The mobile game is planned to have the following design:&#xD;
Game will be presented in Arabic language.&#xD;
The game will consist of four levels. a. At the beginning of each level there will be an educational video that the patient must watch in order to be allowed to start the level.</description>
