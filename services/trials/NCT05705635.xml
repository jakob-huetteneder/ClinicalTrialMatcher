      This trial is a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Docetaxel for Injection (Albumin-bound) and Taxotere in locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma or gastric&#xD;
      esophageal junction adenocarcinoma will be randomly assigned to the test group or the control&#xD;
      group. All patients will receive Docetaxel for injection (Albumin-bound) or Taxotere for&#xD;
      treatment until disease progression. Regular visits and imaging examinations will be&#xD;
      conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the two groups.&#xD;
