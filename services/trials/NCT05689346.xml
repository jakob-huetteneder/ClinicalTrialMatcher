  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Balance reactions and postural control are inadequate in children with CP which affect their&#xD;
      daily living activities. So, different treatment modalities have been used to improve balance&#xD;
      for cerebral palsy children. Recently, High tone power therapy is a new quantum leap in the&#xD;
      field of electro therapy that can be used to stimulate nerves and muscles, so this randomized&#xD;
      controlled study will be conducted to investigate the effect of high tone power therapy on&#xD;
      balance and quality of life in hemiparetic cerebral palsy children.&#xD;

    <description>biodex balance system will be used to assess the dynamic balance: Before the evaluation procedures all children will be given an explanatory session to be aware about the different test steps, also the support rails and biofeedback display screen will be adjusted for each child to ensure comfort and safety during the test procedure, then each child will be trained 1 min for adaptation to the machine. During the test, children will be instructed to stand on the platform in the most comfortable posture, and maintain their visual level by focusing straight ahead on the monitor. The platform will be unlocked and children will be allowed to adjust their foot placement until a comfortable standing position will be achieved while they simultaneously maintained a moving pointer at the center point on the monitor and children will be encouraged to maintain the moving pointer at the center point throughout the test.</description>

    <description>The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) is a questionnaire assessment tool used to evaluate HRQOL in children. It is composed of 23 items that gauge function in the following four areas: physical (eight items), emotional (five items), social (five items), and school (five items). Patients report their function using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4. These responses are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with a higher score indicating a higher QOL.</description>
