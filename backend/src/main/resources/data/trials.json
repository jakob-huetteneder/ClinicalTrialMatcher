    "briefSummary": "This project will evaluate the effectiveness of MINDful TIME, an 8-week mindfulness-based program designed to improve mental health in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and their caregivers. MINDful TIME includes weekly psychoeducational group meetings conducted through videoconferencing and use of a commercially available mindfulness meditation app. We predict that adolescents in the mindfulness intervention group will demonstrate increases in self-reported mindfulness and reductions in self- and parent-reported anxiety and depression relative to a delayed treatment control group. We will also explore whether caregivers in the treatment group demonstrate improvements in quality of life.",
    "detailedSummary": "Interested individuals and their parent/caregiver who meet preliminary eligibility criteria\r\n      during the phone screen will be scheduled for a 1-2 hour virtual study visit to complete an\r\n      intake interview for study and a brief IQ test. If individuals have completed this assessment\r\n      at SARRC within the last five years, they will not be re-assessed; however, they will\r\n      complete a 30-minute virtual intake visit to complete the intake interview, learn about the\r\n      intervention and determine if they would like to participate.\r\n\r\n      Participants in the treatment group will complete three virtual study visits (Baseline,\r\n      intervention exit, 2-month follow-up), whereas participants in the delayed treatment control\r\n      group will complete four virtual study visits (Baseline, wait for the period exit,\r\n      intervention exit, 2 month-follow-up). After completing their second-time point (i.e., wait\r\n      period exit) participants in the delayed treatment control group will be enrolled in the\r\n      8-week intervention.\r\n\r\n      We anticipate that the duration of an individual participant's participation in the study\r\n      from baseline data collection to study completion will be approximately 6 months.\r\n      Participants may be enrolled up to 8 months prior to their baseline data collection depending\r\n      on when they are recruited into the study and whether they participate in cohort 1 or cohort\r\n      2.",

    "briefSummary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of emavusertib (CA-4948) in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in treating patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). CA-4948 is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of abnormal proteins called interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) that signal cells to multiply. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. The usual approach for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is treatment with chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cells from making DNA and may kill cancer cells. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called anti-microtubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Nab-paclitaxel is an albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel which may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of paclitaxel. Giving CA-4948 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel may shrink or stabilize metastatic or unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.",

    "briefSummary": "Wounds can smell bad when they are necrotic, infected, malignant or complicated by fistulas or abscesses. The discomfort and evocations (perception) associated with these smells can be different from person to person. Foul odors are often associated with a repulsive effect. Malodorous wounds can have negative social and psychological repercussions (shame, depreciation, isolation). Malodor is due to the presence of bacteria, whether the wound is colonized or infected. Bacteria release Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) that emit these odors. There are a multitude of anti-odor treatments (conventional or not) that highlight the difficulty of effectively treating this symptom. Charcoal dressings are recommended. Charcoal does not treat the etiology, it is not odorous, but it has the ability to adsorb VOCs. To treat odor, the most prescribed antibiotic is Metronidazole, because its action targets anaerobic bacteria whose presence increases odor. But repeated prescriptions of antibiotics increase the risk of selection pressure, in addition to possible side effects. It's not efficient in all the situations Another strategy is the application of local antimicrobials. But it is effective only if the bacteria responsible for the odors are on the surface of the wound, which is not the case if it is a tumor mass, thick necrosis or abscesses. These local or general treatments do not completely control bad odors in all situations. A new dressing combining adsorption capabilities (reduction of bad odors) with odor release (modification of the perception of residual odors) with cinnamon (CINESTEAM\u00ae) is now available. This work aims to evaluate this new medical device compared to the reference dressing (charcoal) on quality of life, as well as criteria still poorly documented such as discomfort and appetite. The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients with a reduction of at least 0.4 points in the overall score on the Wound-Qol questionnaire (Quality of life). It is estimated that a 0.4 point reduction in the overall score is a clinically relevant reduction for patients and reflects an improvement in their quality of life. An improvement of 0.4 points is expected in 25% of patients in the control arm (charcoal dressing) and in 55% of patients in the experimental arm (cinnamon dressing). The study provides for the inclusion of 98 people with malodorous wounds in 3 hospital located on Ile de France. Day 0: General data on the wound and current treatments will collected, Wound-Qol scale, lifestyle, discomfort related to smell, evaluation of appetite. The evaluated dressings will positioned on the top of primary dressing. They will fix by a non-occlusive or semi-occlusive fixation. The entire dressing will changed 1 time a day for 14 days. Day 1: The patient will assess the discomfort related to the smell before changing the dressing. Day 3: Assessment of the employability of the dressing by the caregiver. Day 7 and 14: Assessment of the discomfort related to the smell by the patient, the caregiver and the entourage. Appetite will assessed with the SEFI\u00ae scale. Day 14 only: Wound-Qol scale and self-questionnaire on the appearance of any discomfort(s)/reaction(s) due to the dressing.",

    "briefSummary": "In Mexico City, the main cause of mortality among people living with HIV (PLHIV) continues to be opportunistic infections (OIs). Early detection of OIs allows their timely treatment and improves their prognosis. The use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) based on antigens of the most frequent causative agents of OIs allows adequate screening of these patients and facilitates decision making at the point of care. Unfortunately, these studies are not widely available in the different PLHIV care centers in the CDMX. We will conduct an open-label, non-inferiority uncontrolled clinical trial to investigate the diagnostic performance of urinary lipoarabinomannan, urinary Histoplasma antigen and serum Cryptococcus antigen in patients presenting for care with advanced HIV in CDMX, supported by rapid cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) testing with lateral flow technology. Four referral hospitals will participate over 12 months. All patients with diagnosed HIV disease and suspected advanced disease presenting for care at participating centers will be included in the study. An inventory of approximately 1000 RDT will be obtained and distributed among the participating sites. A study coordinator will be hired and will visit each site once a week to collect the study variables and follow up on the included patients. The primary outcome of the study will be the percentage of patients with advanced disease who present with diagnoses made by RDT compared to historical controls of patients diagnosed with OI in 2022 at participating centers by conventional methods. Secondary outcomes will be time to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), time to initiation of OI treatment, and 30-day mortality after HIV diagnosis.",

    "briefSummary": "Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death in the West, and rectal cancer accounts for about 25% of colon cancers Low anterior resection has been the mainstay of rectal cancer surgery in low rectal cancer since the 1970s. Although the best efforts of experienced surgeons, The local recurrence rate is 3 to 33% in conventional surgery, while total mesorectal excision (TME) results indicate a recurrence rate of less than 10% The evolution of the concept of TME which was first revealed by Heald.in 1982 made a major shift in the treatment strategies (Rodriguez-Luna et al,2015). The concept of TME was the most important event in surgery for rectal cancer in the last two decades, because even without a curative approach, the local recurrence decreased to 6 to 12%, and 5-year survival improved by 53-87% TME described clear definitions of distal resection margin (DRM), circumferential resection margin (CRM), and least number of harvested lymph nodes, so oncological outcomes improved, locoregional recurrence and survival rates also influenced . Laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME) may be associated with less blood loss, earlier recovery, and lower morbidity. Identification of the small nerves and vessels became easiear because of laparoscopic magnified view of pelvis and thus prevents these injuries (Sajid et al, 2019). Also, minimal surgical trauma will reduce the immunologic response and preserves postoperative immunologic defenses. This may lead to low rate of infections as well as low local recurrences and distant metastases in addition to, tissue handling with less manipulation, 'may reduces the spread of cancer cells TME in obese males with low and anterior rectal tumors is technically challenging especially post neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy due to distortion of the anatomical planes (Ng et al, 2014). In these patients, it is difficult to obtain a proper view of the dissection plane, in open technique which threatens the integrity of TME and carries the risk of positive margins, which is related to higher rates of local recurrence LTME is a widely used approach for rectal cancers; although conversion rate varies from 1.2 to 17%, and it is higher if BMI is equal to or more than 30",

    "briefSummary": "Researchers are looking for a better way to prevent an ischemic stroke which occurs when a blood clot travelled to the brain in people who within the last 72 hours had: - a stroke due to a blood clot that formed outside the heart (acute non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke), or - temporary stroke-like symptoms with a high risk of turning into a stroke (high-risk transient ischemic attack), and who are planned to receive standard of care therapy. Ischemic strokes or transient ischemic attacks result from a blocked or reduced blood flow to a part of the brain. They are caused by blood clots that travel to the brain and block the vessels that supply it. If these blood clots form elsewhere than in the heart, the stroke is called non-cardioembolic. People who already had a non-cardioembolic stroke are more likely to have another stroke. This is why they are treated preventively with an antiplatelet therapy, the current standard of care. Antiplatelet medicines prevent platelets, components of blood clotting, from clumping together. Anticoagulants are another type of medicine that prevents blood clots from forming by interfering with a process known as coagulation (or blood clotting). The study treatment asundexian is a new type of anticoagulant currently under development to provide further treatment options. The way it works, it aims to further improve the standard of care with regard to the risk of bleeding. The main purpose of this study is to learn whether asundexian works better than placebo at reducing ischemic strokes in participants who recently had a non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or temporary stroke-like symptoms when given in addition to standard antiplatelet therapy. A placebo is a treatment that looks like a medicine but does not have any medicine in it. Another aim is to compare the occurrence of major bleeding events during the study between the asundexian and the placebo group. Major bleedings have a serious or even life-threatening impact on a person's health. Dependent on the treatment group, the participants will either take asundexian or placebo as tablets once a day for at least 3 months up to 31 months. Approximately every 3 months during the treatment period, either a phone call or a visit to the study site is scheduled on an alternating basis. In addition, one visit before and up to two visits after the treatment period are planned. During the study, the study team will: - Check vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate - Examine the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG) - Take blood samples - Ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having. An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatments. In addition, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire on quality of life at certain time points during the study.",

PainPac leverages technology to increase patient access to interventions and uses real-time assessment to improve care. PainPac is positioned to rapidly provide improved care through combining biological data (e.g., EMRs, patient collected) with behavioral data to dramatically improve outcomes. PainPac could track beneficial outcomes related to clinical pain scores (e.g., patients with scores 4-8 benefit) and intervention implementation could be based on this; a more advanced possibility is use of geospatial tracking to predict space/time where pain is likely to impact functioning and push an intervention strategy - behavioral or pharmacological. PainPac is designed for future transmission of data to EMRs to inform providers of patient status. This work will provide data to bypass traditional efficacy trials and move quickly to a large effectiveness trial.",
    "detailedSummary": "The investigators will use a pilot RCT to examine PainPac feasibility, patient burden,\r\n      engagement, acceptability, and initial pain-related outcomes, compared to a therapist led\r\n      videoconference delivered behavioral pain intervention (PCST-Video) in colorectal cancer\r\n      patients with pain. Investigators will use quantitative and qualitative data to optimize\r\n      PainPac. Participants will complete assessments at pre-treatment (A1), post-treatment (A2; 4\r\n      weeks post-A1), and 1 month follow-up (A3; 1 month post-A2) (months 5-22). The pain\r\n      management strategies are relevant and efficacious across cancer types. Due to the pilot\r\n      nature of this work, investigators will enroll an opportunity sample of colorectal cancer\r\n      patients.\r\n\r\n      PainPac is a patient-focused intervention developed using cognitive-behavioral theory and\r\n      empirically supported strategies to enhance patients' ability to manage their pain. PainPac\r\n      is a mobile app available to participants on a smartphone or tablet. PainPac uses Social\r\n      Cognitive Theory to promote behaviors to improve pain, self-efficacy for pain management, and\r\n      pain-related quality of life indices. It also uses real-time data to personalize the\r\n      intervention and messaging to participants. PainPac contains 4 modules, each including a\r\n      skill that has shown efficacy for reducing pain in patients with cancer. Patients are\r\n      prompted to complete one module each week for 4 weeks. The app also has interactive\r\n      components to improve coping skills engagement.\r\n\r\n      Participants randomized to PCST-Video will receive 4 behavioral cancer pain intervention\r\n      sessions delivered by videoconferencing by a pain therapist in the medical center to the\r\n      patient in their natural environment (e.g., home). Sessions will be scheduled weekly for\r\n      45-60 min and mimic in person sessions. PCST-Video session content is matches the PainPac\r\n      skills modules described above. PCST-Video participants will complete assessments at the same\r\n      intervals as PainPac participants.\r\n\r\n      Aim 1: Test whether PainPac is feasible (primary aim), low burden, engaging, and acceptable.\r\n\r\n      Aim 2: Examine the impact of PainPac on pain severity, pain interference, pain self-efficacy,\r\n      and quality of life.\r\n\r\n      Aim 3: Gather quantitative and qualitative post-treatment data on patients' preferences,\r\n      barriers, and facilitators regarding PainPac to update and optimize PainPac for a future\r\n      large randomized clinical effectiveness trial.",

    "briefSummary": "Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) have poorer quality of life than healthy people. Despite the high prevalence of psychological issues and its profound influence on quality of life, most IBD patients have limited access to mental health support. As well, many may decline support if it is offered because mental health is often not thought of as part of IBD care. Patients may be able to access cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) through a psychologist, however this intervention is costly and requires considerable commitment on the part of person with IBD. There is a need for new methods of reaching IBD patients to provide information on their psychological needs, and normalize the psychological effects of IBD. These new methods should integrate medical issues with psychosocial issues while being effective, scalable, and low cost to the health care system. 90SecondIBD is a novel way of delivering health information about IBD using Persuasive Design technology embedded in a planned behavior model. This project will investigate the effect of the intervention \"90SecondIBD\", a weekly online health letter, on IBD patients' quality of life and self efficacy. Regression modelling will be performed to explore the ability of clinical and demographic factors to predict quality of life and self efficacy scores following receipt of 90SecondIBD educational health letters weekly for 6 months and 12 months.",

We'll conduct focus group\r\n      interviews in the first year. The interviewers want to invite specialists in the fields of\r\n      long-term care/geriatric nursing education, scholars from the gender talent pool of the\r\n      Ministry of Education, and specialists in the engineering of digital smart systems.\r\n      Additionally, it is intended to include senior front-line long-term care providers in the\r\n      planning and creation of lesson plans for this platform system. A randomized clinical trial\r\n      (RCT) will be adopted which uses a 2-armed, controlled experiment, parallel-group design, and\r\n      multi-center in the second year. The setting and participants will be recruited from four\r\n      long-term care institution in Taipei and New Taipei city. Through the cluster random sampling\r\n      method, two institutions will be randomly selected from the computer based on the \"\r\n      institution \" from each long-term care institution, and then the allocation concealment\r\n      mechanism will be based on the inclusion criteria to recruit research participants, then\r\n      according to their willingness to participate in this project. The intervention will be\r\n      divided into two groups, namely treatment group (AR intervention group) and control group\r\n      (waiting list control group). The experimental group's intervention consists of a course that\r\n      embraces AR's platform for gender empowerment. The intervention course will require 50-60\r\n      minutes for preliminary planning, and participants in the experimental group can design at\r\n      least three course modules to suit their learning needs. The control group will adopt the\r\n      classroom narration method. The following are the primary outcome indicators: gender equality\r\n      knowledge scale, gender equality attitude and awareness scale, self-confidence visual analog\r\n      scale, learning effectiveness and System Usability Scale (SUS). The researcher uses\r\n      structured questionnaires to collect data before intervention (To) and after intervention\r\n      (T1), 1 month (T2) after the intervention. Data will be analyzed using the Generalized\r\n      Estimating Equation to analyze the repeated measurements and intention-to-treat analysis for\r\n      reducing attrition bias.",

    "briefSummary": "The goals of this study is to 1) evaluate feasibility and fidelity of a three-arm RCT containing a twice-weekly exercise intervention supervised by a first-line (oncology) physiotherapist and a 5-day weekly in-hospital exercise intervention versus usual care in patients with rectal cancer or esophageal cancer receiving NCRT, and 2) generate preliminary data on the variability in exercise responses on immune function, immune infiltration, and vascularisation of the tumour. Participants will be randomized in one of three study arms: 1) AE + RE - group; combined moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise (AE) and resistance exercise (RE) twice a week supervised by a specially trained first-line physiotherapist, and a home-based moderate intensity aerobic exercise session once a week; 2) ExPR - group; in-hospital exercise intervention consisting of 30 min moderate intensity aerobic exercise within one hour prior to every radiotherapy session (five times a week); and 3) UC - group; a control group that receives usual care. The main study parameters will be the feasibility in terms of trial participation rate and attendance, and intervention fidelity (e.g. extend of and reasons for adaptations to the exercise intervention). The secondary study parameters are the average effect sizes and measures of variability on immune function, infiltration and vascularisation. Measurements will take place at baseline, directly after finishing NCRT, and within a week before surgery.",
    "detailedSummary": "Strong evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) showed that physical exercise during\r\n      chemotherapy or radiotherapy benefits physical fitness, muscle mass, muscle strength,\r\n      fatigue, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Additionally, exercise may counteract\r\n      treatment-related side effects and help prevent treatment modifications, which might improve\r\n      survival. To date, the majority of RCTs examining the effects of exercise during cancer\r\n      treatment have been conducted in patients with breast cancer or prostate cancer who were\r\n      treated with curative intent. Due to differences in treatment trajectories and side effects,\r\n      generalisability of these findings to patients with other types of cancer is limited.\r\n      Additionally, widespread implementation of exercise in clinical cancer care is hampered by\r\n      the lack of knowledge of the exercise effects on clinical outcome, e.g. tumour recurrence,\r\n      progression and cancer-specific survival. Also, the causality and underlying physiological\r\n      and biological mechanisms linking exercise to clinical outcome are largely unknown. This\r\n      knowledge is essential to understand the potential and limitations of exercise as integral\r\n      part of cancer care and to further optimize exercise interventions. Pre-clinical studies have\r\n      shown that exercise can directly impact tumour growth and function as sensitizer for\r\n      anticancer treatment. However, it is unclear whether these results can be translated to\r\n      patients.\r\n\r\n      Standard treatment for patients with esophageal cancer and for a part of the patients with\r\n      rectal cancer includes neoadjuvant chemoradiation treatment (NCRT), followed by a 6 - 12\r\n      weeks or 8 - 10 weeks waiting period prior to surgical resection, respectively. NCRT might\r\n      reduce tumour size and even induce a pathological complete response. However, pathological\r\n      complete response rate after NCRT is relatively low for these patient populations: 15-20% for\r\n      rectal cancer and 30% for esophageal cancer. A part of patients with rectal cancer are\r\n      treated with radiotherapy (50 Gray in 25 fractions of 2 Gray) for five weeks combined with\r\n      the oral chemotherapy capecitabine. NCRT for patients with esophageal cancer includes\r\n      radiotherapy (41.4 Gray in 23 fractions for 5 days a week) combined with the intravenous\r\n      chemotherapies paclitaxel and carboplatin once a week for 5 weeks. Besides the curative value\r\n      of NCRT it may cause severe treatment-related side effects including diarrhoea, fatigue,\r\n      haematological toxicity, and neuropathy. Exercise training may counteract side effects such\r\n      as fatigue, neutropenia, neuropathy, and gastrointestinal problems (e.g. nausea) while\r\n      simultaneously improving physical fitness and HRQoL. Exercise frequency, intensity, timing\r\n      and type may impact the effects of the intervention. For example, aerobic exercise at higher\r\n      intensities may provide larger cardiovascular benefits, but may result in more\r\n      gastrointestinal side effects. Therefore, it is important to study whether exercise is\r\n      feasible during neoadjuvant chemoradiation, and whether exercise frequency, intensity, and\r\n      timing can induce different effects. Thus, more knowledge is needed on the feasibility and\r\n      effectivity of exercise prescriptions in patients with rectal or esophageal cancer, and the\r\n      robustness of the potential exercise-induced effects across patient populations. Improving\r\n      neoadjuvant treatment in these patients populations might enable more organ saving surgeries,\r\n      and increase survival rates.\r\n\r\n      Potential mechanisms of exercise training influencing clinical and pathological response In\r\n      addition to the well-established influence of physical exercise on physical fitness and the\r\n      HRQoL in patients with cancer, pre-clinical studies showed that exercise training can\r\n      directly influence tumour growth. To illustrate, studies in rodents revealed a few possible\r\n      mechanisms by which exercise training can influence tumour physiology, including\r\n      exercise-induced immune reactions, and alterations in vascularisation and perfusion of the\r\n      tumour. Studies in mice showed exercise-induced immune reactions, stimulated by the release\r\n      of epinephrine and the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 and epinephrine can initiate an\r\n      immune response which mobilises, activates and redistributes natural killer (NK) cells. These\r\n      processes have shown to stimulate the infiltration of activated NK cells in the tumour and to\r\n      reduce tumour growth. Secondly, in mouse-models, exercise training showed to induce a\r\n      'normalisation' of the intratumoural vasculature, reducing hypoxia and thereby improving the\r\n      chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic efficiency. Both pathways might contribute to a more\r\n      rapid tumour regression. Due to differences between animal models and humans, including\r\n      feasible exercise levels, tumour characteristics, metabolic rates and potential\r\n      comorbidities, it is unclear whether these results can directly be translated to (wo)men.\r\n\r\n      The number of studies in patients investigating mechanistic pathways of exercise-induced\r\n      tumour changes are scarce. Long-term exercise training as well as acute exercise bouts are\r\n      characterised by specific physiological responses leading to immediate and chronic\r\n      adaptations. Exploratory studies on exercise during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients\r\n      provided initial support for the hypothesis that exercise can modulate several host- and\r\n      tumour related pathways. These studies showed that exercise influenced circulating systemic\r\n      factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Tumour Necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1,\r\n      interleukins (ILs), and intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Due to the exercise-induced\r\n      release of circulating systemic anti-inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors, aerobic\r\n      training might improve immune activation in patients. Indeed, studies investigating the\r\n      immune system showed that acute exercise induces a mobilisation of NK cells (and an improved\r\n      NK-cell cytotoxicity in patients with cancer. In addition, data from our METRIC pilot trial\r\n      in 14 patients with breast or colon cancer, showed that a 9-week exercise intervention during\r\n      chemotherapy preserved NK-cell functionality (degranulation and cytotoxicity) compared to a\r\n      reduction in the usual care control group, with a 10% difference between groups.\r\n\r\n      To our knowledge there are only two clinical trials in patients who investigated the\r\n      influence of exercise training on tumour perfusion and vascularisation. In the study of Jones\r\n      et al. among women with breast cancer, only limited data was available for perfusion\r\n      assessments due to the relatively high proportion of patients with pathological complete\r\n      responses. The study of Florez Bedoya et al. in patients with pancreatic cancer showed an\r\n      increased number of vessels, elongated vessels, open vessels and an increased microvascular\r\n      density in the tumour of patients who received an exercise intervention compared to historic\r\n      control samples. Studies assessing changes in immune activation in the blood as well as\r\n      intra-tumoural vascularisation and immune infiltration after exercise training during NCRT\r\n      are non-existent in patients with rectal or esophageal cancer.\r\n\r\n      Another potential mechanism through which exercise may affect tumour response to NCRT in\r\n      patients with rectal cancer is an altered microbiome. At the pathology department of\r\n      Radboudumc, dr. Boleij and Prof. dr. Nagtegaal examine the mucosal and fecal microbiome in\r\n      relation to colorectal cancer development and disease progression using in situ detection\r\n      techniques and feces collections at multiple timepoints during disease trajectories. Exercise\r\n      may have a positive effect on the microbiome, by modifying the microbiota and increases\r\n      health-beneficial gut bacteria populations. An insight in changes in the microbiome after an\r\n      exercise intervention during NCRT might provide valuable information about the tumour\r\n      micro-environment. Hence, in this pilot study we want to exploratively include the collection\r\n      of feces in patients with rectal cancer.\r\n\r\n      Besides the effects of exercise training after multiple sessions, pre-clinical studies showed\r\n      that the induced effects of one exercise bout might already interfere with mechanisms\r\n      underlying cancer progression and treatment response. Potential mechanisms for this acute\r\n      phenomenon include mild hyperthermia, augmented tumour perfusion, reduced tumour hypoxia, and\r\n      enhanced immune mobilisation. Even after one exercise bout these mechanisms may enhance\r\n      tumour oxygenation and immunity, which could potentially, driven by accumulative effects of\r\n      repeated acute exercise, result in improved radiotherapy efficacy.\r\n\r\n      An acute bout of exercise in healthy participants induces a large transient increase in\r\n      peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, including NK cells and CD8+ T cells. In addition, an\r\n      acute exercise bout can increase NK-cell cytotoxicity with 50 - 100%. Lymphocyte numbers\r\n      return to below pre-exercise values 1-2 hours after exercise, possibly reflecting a\r\n      redistribution of immune cells to peripheral tissue, which could be beneficial for immune\r\n      surveillance. It was shown that acute exercise in healthy individuals selectively mobilises\r\n      memory CD8+ T cells. Notably, Goedegebuure et al. showed that esophageal cancer patients\r\n      enriched with circulating CD8+ memory T cells prior to the start of treatment were more\r\n      likely to have a pathological complete response after NCRT. Also, high levels of CD8+ memory\r\n      T cell infiltration in the tumour are associated with a good prognosis in both esophageal and\r\n      colorectal cancer.\r\n\r\n      Besides the immune activation, pre-clinical studies showed that acute exercise might impact\r\n      the tumour perfusion and hypoxia. As reported above, several pre-clinical studies report more\r\n      patent and perfused vessels after exercise training, resulting in a larger and more\r\n      homogeneously perfused tumour area. An acute reduction in hypoxia might make the tumour more\r\n      sensitive to the radiotherapy. In addition, exercise-induced hyperthermia of the human body\r\n      might induce vasodilatation, increase perfusion and make the tumour more permissible for\r\n      immune cells. Consequently, linking the immune effects and perfusion effects of acute\r\n      exercise to radiotherapy efficacy reveals the possibility of acute exercise as\r\n      radiosensitizer. A close timing of an exercise session directly prior a radiotherapy session\r\n      might be beneficial for the radiotherapy response. Exercise prior to a radiotherapy session\r\n      was proven to be feasible and safe in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma.\r\n\r\n      The feasibility and safety of an exercise intervention during NCRT in patients with rectal\r\n      cancer and esophageal cancer has been evaluated in previous studies. High adherence rates and\r\n      no adverse events related to the exercise intervention were reported in these studies, and\r\n      most reported barriers were willingness to participate and recruitment of patients. We\r\n      foresee that close collaborations with our multidisciplinary research team (e.g. clinical\r\n      researchers, clinicians,specially trained physiotherapists, tumour immunologist, pathologist)\r\n      and alignment of measurements with routine clinical practice will reduce these barriers.\r\n      These previous studies explored the effects of exercise interventions during neoadjuvant\r\n      therapy on physical activity, fitness, HRQoL, and post-operative complications. Additionally,\r\n      exploratory studies detected that exercise during NCRT in patients with rectal cancer and\r\n      esophageal cancer might lead to an augmented tumour regression. However, both in patients\r\n      with rectal and esophageal cancer, there is only one RCT investigating the feasibility of a\r\n      supervised exercise intervention during NCRT, and none of the currently performed studies\r\n      included investigations of underlying mechanisms of action.\r\n\r\n      To our knowledge there is only one RCT evaluating the feasibility of aerobic exercise prior\r\n      to each radiotherapy session during concomitant chemoradiotherapy (24). This small trial in\r\n      patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer showed that pre-radiotherapy\r\n      exercise was safe and feasible.\r\n\r\n      We aim to conduct a three-arm pilot RCT in patients with rectal or esophageal cancer, while\r\n      simultaneously collecting data on the underlying mechanisms through which exercise can\r\n      influence tumour microenvironment. This pilot will investigate the feasibility of 1) AE + RT;\r\n      an exercise intervention consisting of two exercise sessions per week combining\r\n      moderate-to-high aerobic exercise (AE) and resistance exercise (RE) supervised by a\r\n      first-line specially educated physiotherapist, and one home-based moderate intensity aerobic\r\n      exercise session per week, 2) ExPR; in-hospital exercise intervention consisting of 30 min\r\n      moderate intensity aerobic exercise sessions within one hour prior to every radiotherapy\r\n      session (five times a week). Both interventions are similar in terms of weekly exercise\r\n      volume. Simultaneously, this pilot will gather preliminary data on measures of variability on\r\n      the potential efficacy of exercise on immune function, immune infiltration and\r\n      vascularisation of both exercise interventions. Additionally, we will evaluate the acute\r\n      immune response of one exercise session in patients in the ExPR group.\r\n\r\n      Knowledge on the feasibility and preliminary results of the underlying mechanisms of exercise\r\n      regimes will be a first step towards improved supportive care for patients with rectal and\r\n      esophageal cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation. If the preliminary results on\r\n      underlying mechanisms are promising, we aim to write a grant application to set up a\r\n      sufficiently powered multi-centre randomized controlled trial in cooperation with other large\r\n      medical centres (e.g. Erasmus MC, Amsterdam UMC), focusing on the effects of exercise on\r\n      tumour responses and underlying mechanisms.",

This\r\n      experimental study aims to develop an internet-based self-help money management program that\r\n      improve financial self-efficacy and its associated adverse outcomes among adult population\r\n      with severe mental illness. Its efficacy will be compared with the wait-list control group.\r\n      We hypothesized that (1) participants who received a money management program will improve\r\n      financial self-efficacy after the intervention as compared with the wait-list controls; (2)\r\n      participants from the money management program will have better financial well-being after\r\n      the intervention as compared with the wait-list controls.\r\n\r\n      The online money management program course will consist of 4 weekly modules, incorporating\r\n      the key components of money management and the Model of Human Occupation (MOHO), including\r\n      the concept of money management, money management skill, and risk of financial exploitation.\r\n      Each module will consist of the main component presented in video format, quiz, and homework.\r\n      Materials will be presented interactively to facilitate engagement.",

The goal is to improve capacity for screening and early diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) by training and expanding the healthcare workforce that is competent in endoscopy techniques. The project has three components, a needs assessment, simulation training, and training on live patients. The first part of this project determines the number of providers and endoscopy procedures currently performed in Nigeria, as well as patient access to facilities that have colonoscopy capabilities, through a mixed methods approach. Surveys, focus in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, and use geographic information system (GIS) modeling technology will be employed to perform a needs assessment. The second component of this project investigates whether a locally developed low fidelity (LF) simulation colonoscopy training model is an effective teaching, training, and assessment tool for skill acquisition and confidence compared to a high-fidelity (HF) colonoscopy model. The third component of this project is training healthcare providers on real patients who have an indication for colonoscopy.

    "detailedSummary": "The goal of this project is to build capacity for early diagnosis of CRC by developing a\r\n      comprehensive colonoscopy training program that could in the future lead to credentialing and\r\n      accreditation of a trainee. The first aspect of the project focuses on needs assessment\r\n      analysis as it determines the quantity of providers and access to facilities that perform\r\n      colonoscopy through surveys, focus in-depth interviews, and GIS technology. The second\r\n      component investigates whether a locally developed LF simulation colonoscopy training tool is\r\n      an effective teaching, training, and assessment tool for skill acquisition and confidence\r\n      compared to a HF colonoscopy model in a resource limited setting. The third component of the\r\n      project will assess whether training on a low or high-fidelity simulator then translates to\r\n      improved performance of colonoscopy on live patients. At the end of the project, it is\r\n      expected the number of providers trained to perform colonoscopy in a resource limited setting\r\n      like Nigeria will increase.\r\n\r\n      OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION A mixed methods survey was developed that determines\r\n      the baseline number of endoscopists, nurses, anaesthetists, ancillary staff, costs, and the\r\n      number of procedures performed per year in endoscopy centers in the country of Nigeria. This\r\n      survey will be developed with qualitative specialists at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU)\r\n      and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Healthcare professionals who are part\r\n      of Nigerian medical societies will be invited to participate in the survey through paper,\r\n      electronic, or social media platforms. Focused in-depth interviews with key stakeholders will\r\n      be conducted to further understand the barriers to endoscopy care in Nigeria.\r\n\r\n      Prior to participating in this survey study, the purpose of the study will be explained to\r\n      potential participants. They will be provided information about the research study in written\r\n      form and a consent form will be provided. Consent will be obtained in written form in\r\n      English, since this is the national language medium used for medical professionals in\r\n      Nigeria.\r\n\r\n      Results from this survey and collaborations with medical societies in Nigeria, will provide\r\n      information needed to identify which healthcare facilities perform endoscopy in Nigeria. GIS\r\n      technology will be utilized to analyze patient access to these facilities based on locations\r\n      of facilities to neighborhoods where patients may reside. Qualitative surveys and focus\r\n      interviews with key stakeholders will also provide information on barriers to accessing and\r\n      providing care to patients who need colonoscopy.\r\n\r\n      For the simulation training portion of the study, following initial recruitment, an equal\r\n      number of consented participants will be randomized to learn colonoscopy on high or low\r\n      fidelity models. The HF simulator will be Limbs and Things Colonoscopy Training Model product\r\n      KKM40. The LF simulator will be made in Nigeria, based on low fidelity models that have been\r\n      published in the literature. Prior to beginning the course, the participants will be given\r\n      instructions, a prior experience and confidence survey, and then will be asked to perform\r\n      colonoscopy. This first assessment will serve as a baseline measure of colonoscopy skills.\r\n      The LF group will perform a pretest on LF models, and the HF group will perform the pre-test\r\n      on HF models. Participants will be evaluated utilizing the Mayo colonoscopy skills assessment\r\n      tool and the Global Assessment of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Skills (GAGES) tools that have\r\n      been validated and published in the literature previously.\r\n\r\n      Following this pre-test, study participants will partake in didactic teaching sessions. The\r\n      colonoscopy lecture curriculum will be adapted for the Nigerian context and standardized\r\n      utilizing content based on the American Board of Surgery Flexible Endoscopy curriculum for\r\n      general surgery residents, general surgery resident curriculum (SCORE) endoscopy module, and\r\n      the Joint Advisory group on GI Endoscopy program. Teaching sessions between high and low\r\n      fidelity groups will be identical except for the type of simulation models used to\r\n      demonstrate and practice colonoscopy. Trainees will have the opportunity to practice\r\n      colonoscopy on simulators with immediate feedback from instructors.\r\n\r\n      After this 4-6-hour teaching session, participants will take a post-test identical to the\r\n      colonoscopy pre-test. The next day participants will perform colonoscopy procedures on live\r\n      patients and be evaluated on live patients utilizing the GAGES and mayo colonoscopy skills\r\n      assessment tools. Additionally, at the end of the study, participants will be asked to fill\r\n      out a confidence survey During the live patient sessions, the study will involve patients who\r\n      were scheduled to undergo a clinically indicated colonoscopy. The patients will sign a\r\n      consent form to be part of the study which allows trainees to perform colonoscopy under the\r\n      direct supervision by trained colonoscopy physician. The trainee will be the primary\r\n      endoscopist under the supervision of a faculty endoscopy evaluator. The evaluator will allow\r\n      the study participants independence while ensuring patient safety. The instructor can provide\r\n      verbal instruction if necessary. If the instructors feel the study participant is not making\r\n      progress or if patient safety is of concern, the instructors are permitted to take control of\r\n      the colonoscopy and navigate through difficult portions of the colon or takeover the\r\n      procedure completely. The maximum time that will be allotted for the trainee to complete the\r\n      colonoscopy will be 30 minutes. A critical flaw point will be given to the trainee\r\n      participant if complete takeover occurs, although they will be given the opportunity to try\r\n      again on a different patient if feasible.\r\n\r\n      Trainees will also be evaluated based on total procedure time, time to rectosigmoid junction,\r\n      splenic flexure, hepatic flexure and cecal intubation, % of successful cecal intubation, % of\r\n      time for which the view of the lumen was lost, % of times TI intubation successful, and\r\n      withdrawal time of colonoscopy from cecum, avoidance of bowel perforation and median depth of\r\n      maximal insertion based on the following scale: 1 = rectum, 2 = sigmoid, 3 = descending\r\n      colon, 4 = splenic flexure, 5 = transverse colon, 6 = hepatic flexure, 7 = ascending colon, 8\r\n      = cecum. Additionally, at the end of the study, participants will be asked to fill out course\r\n      satisfaction and confidence surveys.\r\n\r\n      PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES Primary Outcome: To determine whether learning colonoscopy on\r\n      a LF simulation model confers similar skill acquisition and confidence as training on a HF\r\n      model Secondary Outcomes: Determine access to endoscopists and endoscopy facilities barriers\r\n      to endoscopy, and costs of endoscopy in Nigeria. Assess whether training on a low or\r\n      high-fidelity simulator improves colonoscopy performance on real patients. To evaluate the\r\n      overall improvement in technical skills of trainees before and after delivery of a\r\n      simulation-based colonoscopy training program designed to teach colonoscopy in a resource\r\n      limited setting. Investigators will also determine costs of implementing a colonoscopy\r\n      training program as well as costs of endoscopy at each of the facilities.",

    "briefSummary": "The curative principle behind allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is eradication of the malignant cells of the patient (recipient) by donor graft cells, a process termed graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. GVL is traditionally mediated by donor \u03b1\u03b2 T cells in an immunological process driven by genetical differences between individuals, i.e. an allogeneic response. For this reason, \u03b1\u03b2 T cells also cause an unwanted and dangerous complication of HSCT called graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in which healthy recipient cells are targeted by donor cells with great risk of morbidity and mortality to the patient. In addition to \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, other cells from the donor stem cell graft, termed innate effector lymphocytes, can contribute to the GVL effect. These are termed natural killer (NK) cells and T-cell receptor (TCR) \u03b3\u03b4 cells, the latter being a subset of T cells. NK and TCR \u03b3\u03b4 cells can recognize and eliminate leukemic cells in a direct tumor response independent of conventional allogeneicity. Therefore, opposite \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, innate effector lymphocytes cells can mediate GVL but are not likely to cause GVHD. The main indications for HSCT in adults are acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Approximately 50% of AML/MDS transplant patients experience significant acute GVHD and 30% experience relapse of the malignant disease. Prospective clinical studies from the research group of the investigators have shown that patients with high doses of innate lymphocytes in stem cell grafts and during early immune reconstitution after HSCT have a reduced risk of both GVHD and relapse. The aim of this clinical trial is therefore to administer innate donor lymphocyte infusion (iDLI) enriched in NK and TCR \u03b3\u03b4 cells and depleted of \u03b1\u03b2 T cells in patients early after HSCT. By improving the HSCT procedure with iDLI cell therapy the scope is less GVHD and less relapse of the malignant disease and thereby improved survival and life quality in AML/MDS patients.",
    "detailedSummary": "PROJECT DESCRIPTION PURPOSE: To address whether transplant outcomes in patients treated with\r\n      HSCT for AML/MDS can be improved by addition of innate donor lymphocyte infusion (iDLI) early\r\n      after transplantation. The primary outcomes are acute GVHD, relapse and relapse-free survival\r\n      after HSCT.\r\n\r\n      BACKGROUND Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potential curative\r\n      treatment for malignant hematologic diseases. The main indication for HSCT in adults is acute\r\n      leukemia, followed by myelodysplastic syndrome. In HSCT, the bone marrow and immune system of\r\n      the patient is replaced with that from a donor, during an extensive clinical procedure\r\n      carried out in a highly specialized transplant center. The curable principle of HSCT is an\r\n      immune-based cell-to-cell killing of residual leukemic cells mediated by donor cells termed\r\n      the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect.\r\n\r\n      The basic principles of HSCT are given below:\r\n\r\n      Conditioning regimen Prior to donor graft infusion, a conditioning regimen is given in order\r\n      to reduce the tumor burden and weaken the recipient immune system to allow engraftment of\r\n      donor cells. The conditioning regimen can contain different degrees of myeloablation\r\n      depending on the desired grade of immune suppression suitable for the disease, patient age\r\n      and comorbidity.\r\n\r\n      Stem cell donors and grafts The stem cell graft is most often obtained from an HLA-matched\r\n      sibling (25% of patients) or an HLA-matched unrelated register donor.\r\n\r\n      The graft is obtained from the donor either by aspiration of bone marrow or by leukapheresis\r\n      (cell separation and removal of leucocytes from the remaining blood) after administration of\r\n      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which mobilizes stem cells to the blood. The\r\n      latter is known as a peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft and is by far the most common\r\n      graft type used in current era.\r\n\r\n      Graft contents and patient immune reconstitution The stem cell graft contains stem cells that\r\n      establish donor derived hematopoiesis including a functional immune system in the patient,\r\n      but also mature immune cells responsible for early elimination of residual tumor cells\r\n      through the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Immune reconstitution is dependent on the\r\n      dose and contents of the transplanted donor cells and both the graft contents and patient\r\n      immune reconstitution is crucial for the overall outcome of the transplantation.\r\n\r\n      GVL and GVHD The GVL effect is carried out by lymphocytotoxic donor cells that kill residual\r\n      malignant cells of the patient. GVL is traditionally mediated by donor \u03b1\u03b2 T cells in an\r\n      immunological process driven by HLA-differences between individuals, i.e. an allogeneic\r\n      response.\r\n\r\n      In acute graft versus-host-disease (GVHD), also involving HLA allo-recognition, donor \u03b1\u03b2 T\r\n      cells attack the normal tissue in skin, liver and gastro-intestinal system of the recipient,\r\n      leading to a potential deadly immune disease. Acute GVHD occurs during the first 3 months\r\n      after HSCT, and the clinical course is highly variable, from a mild curable presentation to a\r\n      full-blown immune attack, which is fatal in 80-90% of the patients (fig 2). Acute GVHD is\r\n      seen in 40-60% of the patients.\r\n\r\n      Relapse after HSCT Relapse of the hematologic cancer after HSCT is a major cause of\r\n      mortality. In patients with AML/MDS approximately 30% experience disease recurrence after\r\n      HSCT. The prognosis in patients relapsed after HSCT is dismal.\r\n\r\n      Donor lymphocyte infusion In order to prevent relapse or treat manifest relapse after HSCT a\r\n      dose of additional cells from the original stem cell donors, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI),\r\n      can be infused into the patient with the purpose of initiating a renewed/boosted GVL effect\r\n      and eradicate remaining malignant cells. However, the effect on the leukemic cells of\r\n      conventional DLI, containing primarily TCR \u03b1\u03b2 cells from the donor, is uncertain and limited\r\n      by the risk of lethal GVHD why new methods of DLI are constantly under development.\r\n\r\n      Natural killer cells and T-cell receptor \u03b3\u03b4 cells During recent years natural killer (NK)\r\n      cells and T-cell receptor (TCR) \u03b3\u03b4 cells, also termed innate effector cells, have proven\r\n      capable of eliminating cancer cells and thereby contributing to the GVL-effect in HSCT. NK\r\n      cells are innate lymphocytes, comprising approximately 10% of all lymphocytes, and purposed\r\n      to eradicate \"stressed\", malignant and virus-infected cells. They are able to lyse and\r\n      eliminate tumor cells of leukemia through activating receptors of the natural killer (NK) and\r\n      natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) families independent of HLA disparities.\r\n\r\n      T cells of the TCR \u03b1\u03b2 type (CD4 and CD8 T cells) comprise the majority of all circulating T\r\n      cells and lymphocytes in general. TCR \u03b3\u03b4 cells are a subgroup of T cells, different from \u03b1\u03b2 T\r\n      cells, which constitute approximately 5% of all T cells. The repertoire of TCR \u03b3\u03b4 cell\r\n      functions combine features of the adoptive immune system with innate-like responses. They are\r\n      involved in control of inflammation, fighting of pathogens and maintaining tolerance towards\r\n      self-antigens. TCR \u03b3\u03b4 are also capable of recognizing tumor cells through their TCR and\r\n      activating receptors shared with NK cells (e.g. NKG2D) and their anti-tumor effects are being\r\n      increasingly documented against leukemic cells. NK and TCR \u03b3\u03b4 cell recognition is independent\r\n      of HLA-disparities, making their contribution to GVHD less likely, and their immunoregulatory\r\n      features may actually protect against GVHD. These innate effector cells therefore have the\r\n      potential to mediate GVL without GVHD in the HSCT setting.\r\n\r\n      Results from the research group of the investigators:\r\n\r\n      Under this hypothesis, our group conducted a prospective clinical study throughout 2015-2018\r\n      investigating concentrations of NK and TCR \u03b3\u03b4 cells in stem cell grafts and during immune\r\n      reconstitution early after transplantation and associated these with patient outcomes in\r\n      terms of GVHD, relapse and relapse-free survival. Results showed that patients transplanted\r\n      with high doses of NK cells in the graft and high concentrations of NK cells in peripheral\r\n      blood early after transplantation (day 28 and 56) had significantly improved relapse-free\r\n      survival compared to patients with low transplant doses and early post-transplant\r\n      concentrations of NK cells. Regarding TCR \u03b3\u03b4 cells, patients with high concentration of TCR\r\n      \u03b3\u03b4 cells in peripheral blood early (day 28 and 56) after transplantation has significantly\r\n      less GVHD and less relapse resulting in improved overall survival and relapse-free survival\r\n      compared to patients with low post-transplant TCR \u03b3\u03b4 cell concentrations.\r\n\r\n      Based on these results, and existing literature, the aim of this study is infusion of an\r\n      innate DLI (iDLI) containing purified NK and TCR \u03b3\u03b4 cell from the original stem cell donor\r\n      early after HSCT. The expected effect of additional cell therapy with these innate effector\r\n      cells during early immune reconstitution are reduced relapse as well as GVHD rates and\r\n      thereby improved outcomes after HSCT in AML/MDS patients.\r\n\r\n      Procedure This is a collaborative project between the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at the\r\n      Department of Hematology and the Department of Clinical Immunology at Rigshospitalet,\r\n      Copenhagen University Hospital.\r\n\r\n      Approximately 60 patients per year receive PBSC-HSCT for the diagnoses of AML or MDS at our\r\n      center. One out of four patients has an HLA-identical sibling while the remaining patients\r\n      receive stem cell grafts from matched unrelated donors from international donor registries.\r\n      For this study, genetic randomization will be applied so that patients with HLA-identical\r\n      siblings will be included for intervention while patients with unrelated donors receiving a\r\n      standard-HSCT will be included in the control group. The background for the design is donor\r\n      availability; only sibling donors can be recruited to donate iDLI. With an estimated\r\n      recruiting rate of approximately 85%, 13-15 patient/donor pairs in the intervention group are\r\n      expected to be enrolled per year over a total of three years, giving at total of 39-45 pairs.\r\n      In a previous prospective study, the investigators obtained a recruiting rate of 97%.\r\n      Historically, a higher incidence of GVHD was observed in transplants using an unrelated\r\n      donor, but due to more precise HLA-typing and better protocols for immune suppression, GVHD\r\n      and relapse incidence are nowadays comparable between related and unrelated transplants. This\r\n      is also the case at the transplant center at Rigshospitalet, as previously published6.\r\n\r\n      For intervention:\r\n\r\n      Donors will undergo health screening at the Cell Therapy Facility, Department of Clinical\r\n      Immunology, within 30 days before donation (standard procedure). Day 7 before HSCT: Start of\r\n      the conditioning regimen preparing the patient for HSCT (standard procedure) Day 5 before\r\n      HSCT: Start of G-CSF stimulation of the donor in order to mobilize stem cells for\r\n      leukapheresis (standard procedure).\r\n\r\n      Donor leukapheresis and graft infusion to the patients, termed day 0 of HSCT (standard\r\n      procedure) Day 14 after HSCT: donor leukapheresis (without preceding G-CSF stimulation),\r\n      product manipulation and transfusion of iDLI to the patient (intervention).\r\n\r\n      Control group: Standard HSCT-procedure as described above in patients receiving grafts from\r\n      unrelated donors.\r\n\r\n      Procedure of modified DLI = iDLI:\r\n\r\n      White blood cells are obtained from the donor by leukapheresis using the Spectra Optia\r\n      Apheresis. System (Terumo BCT) at the Blood Bank Unit, Department of Clinical Immunology,\r\n      Rigshospitalet. Purification of innate effector cells is carried out by TCR\u03b1\u03b2/CD19-depletion\r\n      of the fresh leukapheresis product with the CliniMACS Prodigy System (Miltenyi Biotec). This\r\n      procedure removes TCR\u03b1\u03b2 T cells together with B-cells (CD19positive cells) rendering a cell\r\n      product enriched in NK cells and TCR \u03b3\u03b4 cells and is routinely used at Rigshospitalet for\r\n      procedures involved in pediatric transplantations.\r\n\r\n      The intended dose of harvested cells is 108 lymphocytes/kg resulting in expected cell doses\r\n      of 107 NK cells/kg and 1-5 x106 TCR \u03b3\u03b4 cells/kg after the depletion. The iDLI product is\r\n      freshly infused into the patient at the Department of Hematology shortly after the depletion\r\n      procedure.\r\n\r\n      Immune phenotyping:\r\n\r\n      Immune phenotyping of the iDLI product as well as the original stem cell graft will be\r\n      performed using a highly standardized customer designed freeze dried flowcytometry panel\r\n      (DuraClone product from Beckman Coulter) developed and routinely used for immune function\r\n      monitoring at the Department of Clinical Immunology. Two tubes will be included for detailed\r\n      lymphocyte phenotyping in this study.\r\n\r\n      Tube 1 includes markers of overall T cells (CD3, CD4, CD8), NK cell subtypes (CD16, CD56), B\r\n      cells (CD19) and monocytes (CD14). Tube 2 includes markers of overall TCR \u03b1/\u03b2 cells, overall\r\n      TCR \u03b3/\u03b4 cells, the two main TCR \u03b3/\u03b4 subtypes (TCR V\u03b41, TCR V\u03b42) and TCR \u03b3/\u03b4 cell activation\r\n      markers (HLA-DR, CD8, CD8beta).\r\n\r\n      The same panel will be used for characterization of immune reconstitution in peripheral blood\r\n      samples in patients at the day of iDLI infusion and 14 and 21 days hereafter (i.e. day 14, 28\r\n      and 56 after transplantation. Viable cells will be cryopreserved for later functional\r\n      studies.\r\n\r\n      Data management plan Clinical data on patient and transplant outcomes will be acquired from\r\n      the clinical transplant database (IBMTR 2019) situated and administrated at the Transplant\r\n      Unit, Department of Hematology. Flowcytometry data from characterization of iDLI products,\r\n      stem cell grafts and patient immune reconstitution will be acquired from the Department of\r\n      Clinical Immunology and processed by appropriate analysis software (Kaluza, Flow Cytometry\r\n      Analysis Software, Beckman Coulter). Clinical and laboratory data will be assembled,\r\n      structured and processed in SPSS (SPSS\u00ae Statistics, IBM) witch together with R (The R Project\r\n      for Statistical Computing, www.r-project.org) will be used for statistical analyses. All data\r\n      will be stored at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital in accordance with data\r\n      protection rules of The Danish Data Protection Agency.\r\n\r\n      Statistical Analyses The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD and relapse in patients treated\r\n      with iDLI compared to patients receiving a standard HSCT will be compared used Gray's\r\n      competing risk analysis. Relapse-free survival between the two groups will be compared using\r\n      the Kaplan Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard models. Cell doses and immune\r\n      phenotyping of iDLI and original stem cells grafts and cell concentrations and phenotyping\r\n      during patient immune reconstitution will be entered using descriptive statistics. SPSS\r\n      (SPSS\u00ae Statistics, IBM) and R (The R Project for Statistical Computing, www.r-project.org)\r\n      will be applied for statistical computing.\r\n\r\n      Power Based on results from previous study from the investigators research group describing\r\n      GVHD, relapse and relapse-free survival in patients with high versus low doses of NK/TCR \u03b3\u03b4\r\n      cells in transplant grafts and during early immune reconstitution. The investigators\r\n      anticipate a reduction in relapse incidence from 30% to 5% and a reduction in acute GVHD\r\n      incidence from 50% to 20%. With genetic randomization, patients with HLA-identical siblings\r\n      will be included for intervention while patients with unrelated donors receiving a\r\n      standard-HSCT will be included as controls. Tested at a significance level of 0.05 with a\r\n      power of 80% (beta 0.2) a sample size of 35-38 patients in each group is appropriate for the\r\n      study.",

The\r\n           randomization provided by the program can be accessed from the link\r\n           https://www.random.org/integers/?num=24&min=1&max=24&col=2&base=10&format=html&rnd=new.\r\n\r\n      Intervention Procedure: After obtaining written consent, peristomal skin integrity of all\r\n      participants will be evaluated on day 0 post-op prior to randomization.\r\n\r\n      Peristomal Skin Integrity Assessment:\r\n\r\n        -  Stoma circumference skin pH measurement\r\n\r\n        -  Skin temperature measurement around stoma\r\n\r\n        -  Measurement of skin moisture around the soma\r\n\r\n        -  Pittman Ostomy Complication Severity Index measurement (It is a 9-parameter evaluation\r\n           scale developed by Joyce Pittman in 2014, and its validity and reliability in Turkish\r\n           were performed by Arslanta\u015f et al. in 2019. The purpose of the scale is to evaluate the\r\n           frequency and severity of early postoperative complications during follow-up in\r\n           individuals with stoma. This index Evaluates leakage, peristomal irritant dermatitis,\r\n           pain, bleeding in or around the stoma, stomal necrosis, stenosis, retraction,\r\n           mucocutaneous separation, and hyperplasia All complications 0 to 3 (0 = absent, 1 =\r\n           mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) (The total score ranges from 0 to 27. Higher scores\r\n           indicate more severe ostomy complications) Between the 0th and 7th day following the\r\n           stoma opening, stoma care will be applied to the patients by the same researcher every\r\n           day, through the skin care solution specific to the group they are in. Peristomal skin\r\n           integrity of the patients will be evaluated on the 3rd and 7th days of the study. Only\r\n           children who can be observed from day 0 following stoma opening and whose stoma can be\r\n           cared for for at least 7 days will be included in the study.

    "briefSummary": "Adding cottonseed oil to the diet has been shown to improve cholesterol profiles and other markers of chronic disease risk in both healthy and at-risk adults. However, CSO has only been tested in the context of high-fat diets. The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the health effects of lower amounts of cottonseed oil (CSO) added to the diet in adults at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The main questions it aims to answer are: - How do different amounts of CSO in the diet affect fasting cholesterol profiles and markers of liver function? - How do different amounts of CSO in the diet affect fasting and post-meal markers of lipid metabolism (i.e. triglycerides) and glycemic control (i.e. blood sugar and insulin)? - How do different amounts of CSO in the diet affect fasting and post-meal markers of chronic disease risk factors such as oxidative stress, inflammation, coagulation potential, and appetite control? Participants will be asked to: - Consume provided breakfast shakes and snacks daily for 28-days. - Attend three weekly short visits for fasting blood draws, body measurements, and collect the next week of study materials. - Attend two longer (5.5 h) testing visits which include eating a standardized breakfast meal and having blood drawn periodically before and after breakfast. Researchers will compare CSO LOW, CSO MID, CSO HIGH, and Control groups (receiving a mixture of oils) to see if lower doses of CSO in the diet impart the same health benefits as previously shown with high doses of CSO.",
    "detailedSummary": "Cardiovascular disease risk factors, including higher BMIs and poor cholesterol profiles, are\r\n      on the rise and contribute to the United States' growing disease burden. Cottonseed oil (CSO)\r\n      is found readily in our food supply. Our previous studies have demonstrated that\r\n      incorporating CSO into the diet is sufficient to reduce fasting total cholesterol (TC) and\r\n      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\r\n      (HDL-c), and improve postprandial lipid and/or glycemic responses in both healthy and at-risk\r\n      populations. However, in these human studies, diets provided 30-44% of total energy from CSO,\r\n      which corresponded to high-fat (HF) diet intake (40-50% of energy). The impact of lower doses\r\n      of CSO on human health has yet to be tested. Therefore, this study aims to investigate\r\n      whether lower doses of CSO are equally effective as previously proven high doses for\r\n      improving fasting and postprandial lipid metabolism and markers of chronic disease risk. If\r\n      lower doses of CSO in the diet are found to improve these markers, these study findings could\r\n      lead to improvements in health.\r\n\r\n      This prospective clinical study is a single-blinded, randomized control trial in adults at\r\n      increased risk for cardiovascular disease (poor cholesterol profiles or overweight/obesity).\r\n      There are four diet interventions: CSO LOW (10% energy from CSO), CSO MID (20% energy from\r\n      CSO), CSO HIGH (30% energy from CSO), and CON (10% energy from control oil mix). The study\r\n      protocol consists of a 28-day intervention where participants are provided breakfast shakes\r\n      and snacks that contain different amounts of cooking oil depending on their random group\r\n      assignment.\r\n\r\n      There are a total of 6 testing visits: screening (v0), pre-intervention (v1), 3 weekly short\r\n      visits (v2, v3, v4), and post-intervention (v5).\r\n\r\n      At screening (v0), qualification is confirmed based on anthropometrics and fasting blood\r\n      draw, which is analyzed for a cholesterol panel and blood glucose. Additionally, energy\r\n      requirements are estimated at this visit for use in the diet intervention.\r\n\r\n      At v1, participants will have anthropometrics measured, including body composition, by\r\n      BodPod. Next, a certified phlebotomist places an IV catheter and takes the fasting blood\r\n      sample. Then the participant consumes a high-saturated-fat meal challenge which delivers 35%\r\n      of their estimated energy needs (from v0). Then the participant has blood drawn 8 times using\r\n      the IV catheter over the next 5 hours.\r\n\r\n      28-day dietary intervention: Before leaving v1, participants are sent home with their first\r\n      week's supply of daily shakes and snacks corresponding to their randomly assigned group. The\r\n      ingredients for the breakfast shakes and snacks are identical between groups, the only\r\n      difference being the amount of the assigned oil incorporated into the foods. All foods are\r\n      portioned based on individual energy needs as estimated at v0.\r\n\r\n      Participants return weekly (v2, v3, v4) to return study materials and collect food for the\r\n      next week. At these weekly visits, participants also have a fasting blood draw, body measures\r\n      and consume their first breakfast shake of the week in the lab.\r\n\r\n      At the end of the 28-day dietary intervention, participants return for v5, where all\r\n      procedures from v1 are repeated.\r\n\r\n      The investigators hypothesize that CSO LOW, CSO MID, and CSO HIGH will improve the proposed\r\n      overall health outcomes and markers of chronic disease risk without changing inflammatory\r\n      markers compared to the control group.",

    "briefSummary": "An impairment in vascular function can lead to the development of age-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death in postmenopausal women. Regular aerobic exercise (AE) benefits vascular function in older men by reducing oxidative stress, however, similar AE training improvements are diminished or absent in postmenopausal women. not using estrogen-based hormone therapy. Vascular function and oxidative stress are improved with AE training in postmenopausal women treated with E2, suggesting an essential role of E2 in vascular adaptations to AE in women. Clinical use of E2 is contraindicated for this purpose, thus establishing alternative pharmacological approaches that could be administered as a substitute for E2 to improve AE signaling for vascular benefits and reducing CVD risk in E2-deficient postmenopausal women is biomedically important. The mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant MitoQ may be an alternative to E2 for restoring AE benefits in E2-deficient postmenopausal women given its recently established effectiveness for reducing oxidative stress and improving vascular function in that population. Accordingly, the overall aim of this application is to assess the efficacy of a 12-week randomized controlled trial of moderate intensity AE training combined with oral MitoQ (20 mg/d) compared to AE+oral placebo (PL) or No AE+MitoQ on vascular vasodilatory function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation; FMD) in healthy E2-deficient postmenopausal women. Insight into the causes for the improvement related to molecules (e.g., nitric oxide) that promote vasodilation, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and the influence of \"circulating factors\" will also be obtained. We hypothesize that AE+MitoQ will improve both FMD > AE+PL and > No AE+MitoQ, and that No AE+MitoQ will improve FMD > AE+PL. The greater improvements in endothelial function with AE+MitoQ vs. both AE+PL and No AE+MitoQ, and with No AE+MitoQ vs. AE+PL will be mediated by greater improvements in nitric oxide production, mitochondrial function, and mitochondrial and oxidative stress linked, at least in part, to changes in \"circulating factors\". The expected results from this study will establish the efficacy of MitoQ for restoring AE-vascular signaling in E2-deficient postmenopausal women and will provide the foundation for development of evidence-based guidelines for sex-specific AE programs for improving vascular health and preventing CVD in postmenopausal women.",

    "briefSummary": "The goal of this pilot, open-label prospective study is to evaluate if the effect of calcium channel blockade on plasma aldosterone levels in people with primary aldosteronism (PA) is due primarily to Cav1.3 blockade. This will be tested by treating participants who have PA with both cinnarizine (Cav1.3 blocker) and nifedipine (Cav1.2 blocker) and evaluating effect on aldosterone levels and blood pressure over a two week course of treatment.",
    "detailedSummary": "Medical treatment for Primary Aldosteronism (PA) is currently limited to mineralocorticoid\r\n      receptor antagonists (MRA), the most widely available of which is spironolactone. This can\r\n      cause numerous adverse effects, especially in men, due to interference with androgen and\r\n      progesterone signalling. Hence, alternative drug targets are needed, one potential of which\r\n      is Cav1.3.\r\n\r\n      The CACNA1D mutation in PA affects the calcium channel Cav1.3. Cav1.3 inhibition may offer\r\n      targeted treatment for patients with mutations in CACNA1D. Cav1.3 has been a candidate for\r\n      novel inhibitors of aldosterone production,4 for which the case is enhanced if\r\n      CACNA1D-mutations underlie the above-described phenotype of PA (asymmetric disease leading to\r\n      failure to achieve cure with adrenalectomy).\r\n\r\n      The calcium-channel blocker, cinnarizine, typically used for vertigo and nausea, has been\r\n      identified to fit the recently described crystal structure of Cav1.3. This raises the\r\n      possibility of using this drug to assess the effect of Cav1.3 inhibition in PA. This may lead\r\n      to further studies involving randomisation and placebo to determine if Cav1.3 inhibition is\r\n      an important method by which aldosterone levels can be lowered in people with PA.\r\n\r\n      This study seeks to explore whether the effect of calcium channel blockade on aldosterone\r\n      levels in people with PA is due to Cav1.3 blockade, by comparing cinnarizine (proposed Cav1.3\r\n      inhibitor) to a conventional calcium channel blocker nifedipine (Cav1.2 inhibitor).\r\n      Cinnarizine is not a likely prospect for long-term treatment of PA, because of its potential\r\n      additional actions as well as Cav1.3 blockade, but using it in this setting, for a short\r\n      period of time, allows exploration of a property of this existing drug (Cav1.3 inhibition).\r\n      Outcomes could form the basis of further exploration of this mechanism for future PA\r\n      treatments.",

No studies have yet assessed the benefits of HFNC versus ST during and after colonoscopy. The investigators designed this unblinded randomized controlled trial to assess whether HFNC, compared to ST, improves oxygenation at the end of the procedure (primary endpoint). Additional endpoints were: 1) the lowest peripheral saturation of oxygen (SpO2) and the number of oxygen desaturations; 2) the changes of end-expiratory lung impedance and tidal impedance assessed by Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT); 3) the effects on diaphragm function assessed by ultrasound (DUS).",

    "briefSummary": "This project includes three studies that explore the effectiveness of brief internet interventions for mental health and loneliness. Study 1: The goal of this clinical trial is to examine if a brief online single-session intervention (SSI) adapted from an evidence-based internet cognitive behavioral therapy can reduce feelings of loneliness in people aged 16 and older who struggle with loneliness. The main question it aims to answer is if a brief SSI is sufficient to meaningfully reduce loneliness compared to an active control. Researchers will test these questions by comparing change in loneliness after 8 weeks between participants randomly assigned to either 1) a 30-minute online SSI for loneliness or 2) a 3-session online intervention for loneliness or 3) an active control SSI. Study 2: The goal of this clinical trial is to examine if an SSI for psychological distress that uses popular online content as its primary form of intervention content can reduce feelings of psychological distress in people aged 16 and older who struggle with psychological distress. The main questions it aims to answer are 1) if curated popular online content can be more effective in supporting people struggling with psychological distress than researcher-created content and 2) if curated popular online content can be more effective in supporting people struggling with psychological distress than un-curated self-selected popular online content. Researchers will test these questions by comparing change in distress after 8 weeks between participants randomly assigned to either 1) 25-minute popular online content-based SSI for distress or 2) an effective 25-minute online SSI for distress with evidence-based researcher-created content or 3) online help-seeking as usual. Study 3: The goal of this clinical trial is to examine if an SSI for loneliness that uses popular online content as its primary form of intervention content can reduce feelings of loneliness in people aged 16 and older who struggle with loneliness. The main questions it aims to answer are 1) if curated popular online content can be more effective in supporting people struggling with loneliness than researcher-created content, 2) if curated popular online content can be more effective in supporting people struggling with psychological distress than an active control, and 3) replicating the comparison in study 1, if a brief SSI is sufficient to meaningfully reduce loneliness compared to an active control. The study will test these questions by comparing change in loneliness after 8 weeks between participants randomly assigned to either 1) a 25-minute popular online content-based SSI for loneliness or 2) a 25-minute online SSI for loneliness with evidence-based researcher-created content or 3) an active control SSI.",
    "detailedSummary": "Study 1: Severe loneliness is globally prevalent and is strongly associated with impaired\r\n      mental and physical well-being, making it a significant public health issue. Evidence-based\r\n      interventions for loneliness reach a small subset of people who might benefit from them, so\r\n      identifying new strategies for addressing loneliness at scale should be a high priority.\r\n      Online single-session interventions (SSIs) have demonstrated particular promise to offer\r\n      efficient and highly-scalable support to diverse populations.\r\n\r\n      The study will test if an internet-mediated self-guided SSI can produce lasting improvements\r\n      in loneliness. The investigators adapted a 9-week online loneliness intervention into a\r\n      3-week 3-session version and a single-session 30-minute SSI version. The investigators will\r\n      randomly assign participants to complete the 3-week version, the SSI version, or a control\r\n      SSI.\r\n\r\n      The investigators will collect self-report measures at baseline, directly after the\r\n      intervention, and 4 and 8 weeks after baseline. The investigators will also measure\r\n      participant engagement with the intervention using self-report and behavioral measures. The\r\n      investigators will recruit teens and adults (16+) for the study via social media.\r\n\r\n      Study 2: SSIs for mental health have shown promise for delivering efficient support to\r\n      diverse populations. Despite their brevity, existing SSIs still struggle to engage users.\r\n\r\n      This study will explore using a broad range of mental health-relevant popular online content\r\n      (eg, psychology lectures on YouTube, Instagram posts from self-care influencers, and blog\r\n      posts written by people who struggle with mood disorders) in SSIs. Although it is often not\r\n      evidence-based, popular online content may be more appealing and tailored to particular\r\n      audiences than the researcher-created intervention content typically used in evidence-based\r\n      SSIs.\r\n\r\n      In this study, researchers will examine the effectiveness of this content for addressing\r\n      psychological distress. Researchers will conduct an experiment to compare a popular online\r\n      content-based SSI to one that has already demonstrated efficacy and to online help seeking as\r\n      usual to identify whether such content is useful within an SSI context. Researchers will\r\n      measure change in psychological distress from baseline to 4-week and 8-week follow-ups.\r\n\r\n      Study 3: In this study, researchers aim to replicate and extend studies 1 and 2 to further\r\n      evaluate the potential of an SSI for loneliness and the utility of popular online content as\r\n      a mental health intervention.\r\n\r\n      In this study, researchers will examine the effectiveness of popular online content for\r\n      addressing loneliness. Researchers will conduct an experiment to compare a popular online\r\n      content-based SSI for loneliness to another online SSI for loneliness with researcher-created\r\n      content and to an active control SSI. Researchers will measure change in loneliness from\r\n      baseline to 4-week and 8-week follow-ups.",

During breastfeeding, mothers need to maintain the same position with their hands for\r\n      long periods of time, which can lead to muscle pain due to improper posture. In addition,\r\n      postpartum fatigue can also lead to newborn fall accidents (Lipke et al., 2018).\r\n\r\n      Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of a modified pillow to enhance the comfort and\r\n      safety of postpartum women during breastfeeding.\r\n\r\n      METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted.

    "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to improve cancer patient's health, survival, and quality of life by dispelling risk behaviors for Northwestern Memorial Health Care (NMHC) patients who are cancer survivors. The main question[s] STELLAR aims to answer are: - How best to combine three behavior interventions (physical activity promotion, smoking cessation, obesity treatment) into one treatment. - Evaluate the reach of the program. We will look at the number, proportion, and representativeness of participants in terms of disease characteristics, socioeconomic status, telehealth readiness, and race/ethnicity. - Evaluate the effects of the STELLAR program relative to enhanced usual care (information provision) on cancer risk behaviors, patient care access, care quality, and communication. Participants will be provided goals related to their physical activity, smoking, and/or weight loss and asked to track their health behaviors via an app, excel file, or on paper. At baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months into the study, participants will provide survey responses and physical measurements like height and weight. Additionally, those in the STELLAR group will complete 16 telehealth sessions with study staff to discuss progress towards their study goals. Researchers will compare the STELLAR intervention group to the Enhanced Usual Care group to see if the STELLAR intervention group is able to reach more participants that Enhances Care only.",

Rapid diagnosis and termination of pregnancy are still the gold standard main treatment for pre-eclampsia. Rapid control of blood pressure showed to provide protection against many adverse effects of preeclampsia as intracranial hemorrhage, subcapsular hepatic hematoma and acute kidney injury (AKI). In Assiut university hospital ICU regimen, glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was used primarily for this purpose. But it was accused in many cases as a cause for AKI without any other organ damage along with the severe preeclampsia disease. Some previous studies supported this assumption as , Ying-Hsuan .T. et.,al during their study of GTN on renal outcome during cardiopulmonary bypass in cardiac surgery. Phentolamine infusion is a new rising alternative for an old drug with a high safety profile. In this research protocol the researchers will study comparative effect of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) versus phentolamine on renal outcome in severe pre-eclampsia patients during their stay in obstetric ICU.",

    "briefSummary": "The transition period to full oral feeding in infants with perinatal asphyxia is important in predicting long-term outcomes. The transition to independent oral feeding is accepted as a discharge criterion by the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the long transition from tube feeding to oral feeding prolongs the discharge process. Prolonged transition to oral feeding increases maternal stress as it delays gastrointestinal problems, mother-infant interaction and attachment, as well as increasing health expenditures. Due to long-term feeding tube use; Infection, leakage, delay in wound healing, trauma caused by repeated placement, as well as oral reluctance are observed. In asphyxia infants, in whom oral-motor dysfunction is common, the transition to oral feeding takes a long time and tube feeding support is required. The effect of hypothermia, which is a general therapeutic intervention that reduces the risk of mortality and morbidity in infants with asphyxia, on oral feeding has been previously studied and shown to have a positive effect. They also found that MR imaging in infants with asphyxia and the need for gastrostomy and tube feeding in those with brainstem involvement were associated. Various interventions that affect the transition to oral nutrition positively and shorten the discharge time are included in the literature. Stimulation of non-nutritive sucking (NNS) is the most frequently preferred method among these interventions. It has been shown in studies that there are no short-term negative effects of NNS stimulation with the help of a pacifier or gloved finger, and some clinical benefits such as better bottle feeding performance, acceleration of discharge and transition to oral feeding. The effect of the NNS stimulation method, which has been shown to be effective in preterm infants with large-scale randomized controlled studies, is not known exactly. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of NNS stimulation applied to oral feeding, feeding skills, weight gain and discharge in asphyxia infants receiving hypothermia treatment.",
    "detailedSummary": "Perinatal asphyxia is the interruption of fetal blood flow or gas exchange during the\r\n      perinatal period. Injury to the brain as a result of systemic hypoxia caused by disruption of\r\n      gas exchange and slowing of cerebral blood flow is called hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy\r\n      (HIE). Perinatal asphyxia may be maternally related or may occur as a result of conditions\r\n      related to the placenta and the newborn itself. It may have etiologies such as maternal\r\n      diseases such as diabetes, hypertension or preeclampsia, uterine rupture, cord compression,\r\n      congenital airway anomalies of the newborn, neurological disorder, and severe cardiopulmonary\r\n      disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, perinatal asphyxia causes 4\r\n      million newborn deaths every year and constitutes 23% of total neonatal deaths. Asphyxia,\r\n      which has effects such as death, seizures and HIE in the short term, has effects such as\r\n      motor disorders such as cerebral palsy, sensory disorders such as vision and hearing loss,\r\n      cognitive, neurodevelopmental, behavioral and emotional disorders in the long term.\r\n      Malnutrition is a problem that can occur both in the short and long term. In the short term,\r\n      it may have consequences such as orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding due to sucking and/or\r\n      swallowing dysfunction, prolonged feeding times in the long term, frequent coughing,\r\n      aspiration pneumonia and gastrostomy.

    "briefSummary": "Introduction: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized as a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the progressive loss of dopamine in the basal ganglia region, resulting in classic motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability and tremor. Such symptoms end up affecting the functionality of the upper limbs (ULM) in this population. In recent years, therapy based on Virtual Reality (VR) has been gaining popularity, but studies in the area are still lacking. Objective: To verify the benefits of immersive and non-immersive virtual reality in the functionality of the upper limbs in individuals with PD, and to identify possible differences between them. Methodology: This is a randomized clinical trial, in which the evaluators will be separate from the experimental groups (single-blind). Subjects with PD will be randomized into two groups: Immersive group (IVR), which will receive treatment with virtual reality games in an immersive environment through Leap Motion Controller (LMC) devices together with image projection on a Head-mounted -display (Oculus Quest) and the non-immersive group (RVnI) in which they will receive treatment with the CML on a flat screen. Both treatments will focus on broad and fine upper limb tasks, in a protocol with 4 activities and duration of 27 minutes, twice a week, for eight weeks. The two groups will be evaluated in three moments: before the intervention, immediately after 8 weeks and 60 days after the end of the interventions. They will be analyzed in terms of ADLs, through the TEMPA test and part II of the unified assessment of PD (MDS-UPDRS II); motor assessment (part III) of the MDS-UPDRS and motor staging of PD (Hoehn & Yahr); manual dexterity through the Box and Block test and through the Nine Hole Peg Test; cognition by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); quality of life through the PD questionnaire (PDQ-39); the usability of the system (SUS); and possible side effects (Simulator Sickness Questionnaire). This study is expected to show that treatment with immersive VR has greater positive effects than non-immersive VR on the functionality of the upper limbs of individuals with PD.",
    "detailedSummary": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized as a complex neurological disorder, with classic\r\n      motor symptoms that are mainly associated with the development of Lewy bodies within nerve\r\n      cells and with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Among the most\r\n      characteristic motor symptoms of the disease, tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural\r\n      instability and gait difficulty are included. Consequently, such motor comorbidities directly\r\n      impact the patient's life, affecting quality of life, increasing the risk of falls, and\r\n      decreasing independence in general. PD is currently the second most prevalent\r\n      neurodegenerative disease (after Alzheimer's disease), with a rate of 14 affected per 100,000\r\n      inhabitants; when considering the population over 65 years old, the values rise to 160\r\n      affected per 100,000 inhabitants. Approximately 60,000 new cases of PD are diagnosed each\r\n      year in the United States, in addition to the more than one million cases already diagnosed.\r\n      In Brazil, it is estimated that 200,000 individuals have PD in the general population, with a\r\n      high prevalence in people aged between 60 and 79 years. About 36,000 new cases arise in the\r\n      country each year. The incidence rate of Men-Women varies between 1.3 and 2.0 in most of the\r\n      recorded data. In 2012, Noyce et al. analyzed 30 environmental factors that could be related\r\n      to the development of PD, among which those that were highly significant: exposure to\r\n      pesticides, previous injury to the skull region, living in a rural area, use of\r\n      beta-blockers. , workers in rural areas and consumption of water from wells. Among the\r\n      protective factors found are: smoking, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, caffeine\r\n      consumption, use of calcium channel blockers and alcohol consumption. Among the genetic\r\n      factors best described in the literature are the SNCA genes, which encode the alpha-synuclein\r\n      protein; mutations in LRRK2; mutations in the GBA gene, which encodes the\r\n      beta-Glucocerebrosidase enzyme, which is the main genetic risk factor found until then for\r\n      the development of PD.\r\n\r\n      Lewy bodies were first described in 1912 by Friedrich Henrich Lewy, becoming a major\r\n      pathological marker of PD. They are found inside neurons and are made up of neurofilaments\r\n      with aggregates of alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin. In 2007, through the study by Wakabayashi,\r\n      he showed that Lewy bodies were not directly related to the causes of PD, but to its\r\n      symptoms.\r\n\r\n      In general, the pathophysiology of PD is characterized by a progressive neuronal loss of the\r\n      compact part of the substantia nigra of the midbrain, requiring a loss of more than 60% for\r\n      the main symptoms of the disease to appear. However, in addition to the deficit in the\r\n      dopaminergic pathway, other neurotransmitters may also be involved in the pathophysiology of\r\n      PD. In the noradrenergic system, the locus coeruleus, presents the loss of 50 to 80% of\r\n      pigmented neurons, in addition to the reduction of neurons in the dorsal vagus nucleus and in\r\n      the supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, accompanied by a decrease in the\r\n      function of the noradrenergic projections; In the serotonergic system, a reduction of 57.8%\r\n      of neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus is observed; And in the cholinergic system, a\r\n      reduction of 50 to 60% of cholinergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus was observed.\r\n\r\n      In 2003, a study developed by Braak et al. showed that PD begins in Meissner's gastric\r\n      autonomic plexus and in the olfactory neural endings, propagating to the brainstem\r\n      (midbrain), precisely in the dorsal vagus nuclei, glossopharyngeal nucleus, olfactory and in\r\n      the intermediate area. From there, evolution is divided into 5 more stages, namely: 1 - raphe\r\n      nuclei, gigantocellular nucleus and locus coeruleus; 2 - compact part of the substantia\r\n      nigra; 3 - forebrain areas of the temporal mesocortex; 4 - areas of association of the\r\n      frontal neocortex; 5 - neocortex association areas, premotor and motor areas.\r\n\r\n      The main motor symptoms of PD are bradykinesia, hypokinesia, akinesia, tremor and rigidity,\r\n      as well as balance and gait deficits. In addition, cognitive disorders, memory deficits,\r\n      problems related to visuospatial dysfunction, difficulties in performing sequential and\r\n      repetitive movements, freezing and slow psychological responses are often present. Decreased\r\n      writing and problems in the voice and swallowing of individuals can also be observed. Among\r\n      the main clinical symptoms of PD is tremor, which in about 50% of cases begins in the distal\r\n      extremities. In rest situations, the decrease or disappearance of this symptom is noticeable,\r\n      which returns if the individual maintains a more prolonged action or posture. Bradykinesia\r\n      (slowness of movement) is due to an imbalance between the inhibitory and excitatory systems,\r\n      resulting from the absence of dopamine in the striatum, affecting mainly automatic movements,\r\n      generating a general poverty of movement and frequent complaint of weakness. Patients with PD\r\n      have a high chance of acquiring a posture with their center of gravity forward, generating a\r\n      bent or flexed posture. There is also a decrease in postural reflexes, such as protective\r\n      extension, balance, and righting reactions. The gait presents itself as a slow, shuffling\r\n      gait with a shortened stride length.\r\n\r\n      Pharmacological treatment consists of drugs that increase intracerebral concentrations of\r\n      dopamine or stimulate its receptors. In the first line of treatment are Levodopa, which\r\n      corresponds to an immediate precursor of dopamine, which, unlike it, can cross the\r\n      blood-brain barrier. Bromocriptine, Lissuride, Pergolide and Paramixepol are dopamine\r\n      receptor (D-2) agonist drugs, being dopaminomimetics, used alone or in association with\r\n      Levodopa. Cardidopa is usually associated with Levodopa to facilitate the drug's action on\r\n      the central nervous system, thus decreasing its side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, loss\r\n      of appetite, and accelerated heart rate, in addition to increasing its therapeutic\r\n      effectiveness. In the second line of treatment are central anticholinergics, which exert\r\n      their therapeutic effects by blocking the central cholinergic transmission of acetylcholine,\r\n      restoring balance with dopamine. In the third line of treatment are the catechol-o-methyl\r\n      transferase (COMT) inhibitors, which act by blocking the conversion of levodopa to\r\n      3-O-methyldopa, thus increasing the half-life in plasma and the fraction of the dose that\r\n      reaches the brain. Also in the third line of treatment are irreversible inhibitors of the MAO\r\n      enzyme type B, which also inhibit the reuptake of dopamine from the synaptic space.\r\n\r\n      However, even with an adequate pharmacological treatment for the management of PD, the\r\n      patient can still present significant functional losses, which will directly affect their\r\n      activities of daily living and their participation in society. The physiotherapeutic\r\n      treatment aims to enable the individual with PD to maintain their maximum level of activity\r\n      and mobility, being an adjunct therapy to the isolated pharmacological treatment.\r\n      Physiotherapy applied to patients with PD ends up focusing mainly on: postural adjustments,\r\n      transfer maneuvers, improvement in upper limb function, balance, physical capacity, cognitive\r\n      capacity, and gait; always seeking patient independence and improving their quality of life.\r\n      Among some of the adjuvant therapies already studied in PD, we can mention: induced\r\n      containment therapy, dance, martial arts, Nordic walking, aquatic therapies, and music\r\n      therapy. Upper limb dysfunctions are frequently present in individuals with Parkinson's\r\n      disease. Among the first motor signs we can highlight micrograph and resting tremor. Resting\r\n      tremor is defined as a tremor of 4 to 6 Hertz in frequency in a limb that is fully at rest,\r\n      which temporarily disappears during movement and can be aggravated during situations of\r\n      emotional stress. Accompanied by a slowness and progressively smaller movements (hypokinesia)\r\n      characterizing bradykinesia, and an involuntary rigidity during a passive movement of a joint\r\n      (cogwheel phenomenon). A great loss of manual dexterity is also observed, which is\r\n      independent of the presence of bradykinesia or tremor. This phenomenon is coined as \"Kinetic\r\n      apraxia of the limb\", which is a loss of fine motor skills not explained by elementary motor\r\n      deficits, such as weakness or ataxia.\r\n\r\n      As the disease progresses, such dysfunctions end up impacting daily life tasks such as\r\n      getting dressed, brushing teeth, eating, buttoning buttons, using cell phones and, as a\r\n      consequence, we perceive a worsening in the quality of life of individuals with PD. In\r\n      addition, despite the known benefits of dopaminergic therapy for the management of PD\r\n      symptoms, it is shown to be ineffective in improving coordinated arm and hand movements,\r\n      which affect the individual's functional reach and grip movements.\r\n\r\n      Among the treatments presented in the literature for the management of upper limb deficits in\r\n      individuals with PD are techniques based on repetition training in single and dual tasks;\r\n      mirror therapy; restraint-induced therapy; and sensorimotor training. As well as several\r\n      publications in recent years have been portraying the use of VR for the treatment of upper\r\n      limb deficits in patients with PD, showing promising results in the area.\r\n\r\n      In recent years, interest in Virtual Reality (VR) has been growing exponentially, but the\r\n      technology has been used for some decades. VR was a term proposed and popularized in 1989 by\r\n      Jaron Laurier. VR is generated from computer graphics processing, in which simulations of\r\n      objects, spaces and events are offered to the user's visual field in order to mimic a real\r\n      experience. In addition to the visual offer, an auditory, tactile or even olfactory component\r\n      may be present in order to guarantee a greater multisensory stimulus together with the\r\n      possibility of real-time interaction between them. There is then a direct relationship\r\n      between the number of sensory channels generated by the computer that are offered to the user\r\n      and the level of immersion generated, which may vary according to the type of hardware used.\r\n      The virtual environment can be delivered to the user through traditional displays in two\r\n      dimensions (2D), projected through glasses in three dimensions (3D) or in devices called\r\n      Head-mounted display (HMD).\r\n\r\n      Among the elements in which VR is modeled, \"Interactivity\" represents the user's ability to\r\n      actively participate in the experience generated by VR. It is influenced by the\r\n      responsiveness of the system, graphics, sounds and degrees of freedom that are provided to\r\n      the user in the Virtual Environment (AV). \"Presence\" is the perception that the environment\r\n      and virtual objects are really there and that the user is inserted between them; In which\r\n      there is nothing that separates the \"I\" and the AV. Another feature is \"Perceived Reality\" in\r\n      which the AV is to some degree similar to the real world. Finally, immersion can also be\r\n      amplified when there is an emotional and/or cognitive affective component during the\r\n      experience, being related to intrinsic factors of the user, including physiological\r\n      parameters such as heart rate, skin conductance and psychological factors, such as\r\n      personality traits of the user.\r\n\r\n      Therefore, the term Virtual Reality can be more related to the user experience than to a\r\n      device itself.\r\n\r\n      In 1997, Mel Slater & Sylvia Wilbur also proposed five characteristics to which they\r\n      structure a virtual environment (VE): (a) Inclusive; refers to an AV that eliminates signals\r\n      that indicate the existence of a physical world separate from the virtual world (eg external\r\n      noise, joystick weight); (b) Extensive; refers to the number of sensory modalities stimulated\r\n      (eg, tactile, auditory.); (c) Surrounding; refers to the visual presentation of the AV,\r\n      including the ocular field of view (CVO) and the degree to which the real world is excluded\r\n      (eg, Head-mounted Display, computer screen). (d) Vivid; refers to the resolution and fidelity\r\n      of the image generated by the device (eg visual information); (e) Correspondent; refers to\r\n      how the VE is modified in response to the user's perspective and actions. The use of VR has\r\n      been used in several areas, in the scope of entertainment, professional training, military\r\n      area, among the most diverse applications. The first record of its use in the medical field\r\n      dates back to the early 1990s, and currently it has been widely used both for teaching in the\r\n      health area and for clinical practice, finding promising results in the area of physical and\r\n      intellectual rehabilitation.\r\n\r\n      The motor rehabilitation process is influenced by three major factors: (a) early\r\n      intervention; (b) task-oriented training; (c) intensity and repetition. Tasks that include\r\n      various sensory processes (hearing, proprioception, vision, touch) are necessary in order to\r\n      promote an improvement in function. Another important factor for the success of the treatment\r\n      is based on the patient's engagement with the tasks oriented to him, and his motivation to\r\n      perform them. However, patient engagement in traditional neurological rehabilitation programs\r\n      seems to be low, and often the intensity dose used during sessions seems to be insufficient\r\n      to generate the greatest possible clinical improvement. Non-adherence to treatment can, in\r\n      addition to generating a low effectiveness in the result, have a high economic cost.\r\n\r\n      In this context, rehabilitation therapy using VR proves to be a viable alternative for the\r\n      neurological population, being in some cases more effective than the conventional therapy\r\n      widely used today. VR stands out for being a recommended technological approach to improve\r\n      movement learning, through visual, auditory or tactile feedback, the user is able to work\r\n      both motor and cognitive processes at the same time, through a challenging and motivating\r\n      environment. . Among the advantages of VR are the ability to modify the VE for scenarios of\r\n      real patient situations, and individualize treatment needs. In addition, an external observer\r\n      can activate the activity and record the entire performance of the task proposed to the user,\r\n      thus analyzing their progress. Also in the last decade, VR has been successfully used in the\r\n      scope of telerehabilitation, a modality that has been in constant demand in recent years.\r\n\r\n      Design systems designed in Head-Mounted Display were first conceived in the 1960s in the Utah\r\n      transformation by the then first of Ivan Sutherland's graphic transformation. It is defined\r\n      as a helmet in which, using two lenses, the images are seen by the individual wearing them,\r\n      making it possible to use them for immersive EVs in VR . In the last decades, with the cheap\r\n      technologies, the use of HMDs for VR has several applications for the general public, in\r\n      education, entertainment, and in the medical field. Among the HMD models that are available\r\n      for general public use, we can mention the HTC VIVE (HTC Corporation\u00b8 Taiwan); Valve Index\r\n      (Valve Corporation\u00b8 Washington, USA); and the Meta Quest 2 (Meta Inc.\u00b8California,USA). Thanks\r\n      to the portability and low cost of the sensor, the LMC is suitable for performing exercises\r\n      in a therapeutic and home environment, without extensive supervision. Much of the current\r\n      literature focused on rehabilitation has been using non-immersive VR devices, and reviews in\r\n      the area point to a large gap in studies that use more immersive devices for the treatment of\r\n      such conditions. The use of a more immersive LV for treatment through HMD can be much more\r\n      intuitive to interact with than in environments projected on flat screens and generate better\r\n      results in the rehabilitation of the upper limbs, reducing external distractions, increasing\r\n      the focus of the immersed individual, and generating greater user motivation. Due to the lack\r\n      of studies in the area, the study in question aims to investigate the possible benefits that\r\n      a therapy based on an exposure protocol in different degrees of immersion in VR impacts on\r\n      the functional aspects of the upper limbs of individuals with PD.\r\n\r\n      PD is currently the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the world , and\r\n      despite advances in disease control, upper limb motor disorders seem to show little response\r\n      to pharmacological treatment. In recent years, with the advancement of technology and its\r\n      increasingly easy access to the general population, the use of VR-based neurological\r\n      rehabilitation has been gaining more and more notoriety. The use of VR in rehabilitation has\r\n      already proved to be a viable, safe alternative, with similar or superior results to\r\n      conventional therapies adopted by Physiotherapists and/or Occupational Therapists . Among the\r\n      characteristics of VR in which the literature already proves its use, are the\r\n      individualization of the treatment, the ability to modify it to mimic everyday tasks, the use\r\n      in telerehabilitation and the ability to provide instant feedback to the patient and\r\n      therapist, characteristics essential for greater effectiveness in a rehabilitation protocol.\r\n\r\n      Despite the increasing progress in research, studies with a good methodological quality in\r\n      this area are still lacking. In addition, several reviews on the subject point to the lack of\r\n      studies comparing the different types of immersion in the treatment of neurological\r\n      conditions . In addition, more quality studies are needed to develop guidelines for clinical\r\n      practice using VR, generating more patient safety and an improvement in the cost and\r\n      effectiveness of treatment.\r\n\r\n      The general objective of the study will be to verify the effects of an intervention protocol\r\n      using a non-immersive Virtual Reality device (Leap Motion Controller and Flat Display) and\r\n      Immersive Virtual Reality (Leap Motion Controller and HMD) on the functionality of the upper\r\n      limbs of individuals with Parkinson's disease.",

    "briefSummary": "Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses natural or synthetic chemicals and biological agents to kill rapidly proliferating cells. As chemotherapeutic drugs prevent the growth and proliferation of cancer cells, they also inhibit the growth of normal cells such as intestinal and oral mucosal epithelium, bone marrow cells, and hair follicle cells. During chemotherapy treatment, which is widely used in the treatment of cancer cases and considered one of the most effective methods of cancer treatment, individuals; may experience side effects such as nausea-vomiting, loss of appetite, mouth ulcers, pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and changes in their skin and nails. There are several factors that can trigger anxiety in cancer patients: fear of cancer and its treatment-related side effects, fear of relapse after treatment, uncertainty, concerns about changing roles and relationships, and fear of death. Treatment methods are available for a variety of side effects and negative effects experienced by cancer patients. These methods include pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. For example, benzodiazepines are frequently used to treat anxiety in cancer patients. If benzodiazepines are not adequate, low-dose antipsychotics can be used. However, benzodiazepines and their derivatives may reduce respiratory function, induce sedation, and cause confusion. Music is an example of non-pharmacological cognitive-behavioral treatment that is used to control negative symptoms in many fields. The use of music for healing is easy, has no side effects, and is beneficial for physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Anxiety and fear can be reduced by therapeutic music, which increases endorphin secretion and positive emotions. Treatment of serious illnesses such as cancer requires a holistic approach that includes psychological, social, and spiritual support in addition to pharmacological treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine how different types of music affect cancer patients' anxiety and satisfaction during chemotherapy.",

The incidence of complication related to nerve block (urinary retention, hematoma, hypotension and arrhythmia). 4. Patient satisfaction",
    "detailedSummary": "Postoperative pain is a common complication that may cause a neuroendocrine stress response,\r\n      which is characterized by increased release of catabolic and immunosuppressive pituitary\r\n      hormones and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Excessive postoperative pain and\r\n      the physiological stress response can influence postoperative outcomes, length of hospital\r\n      stay and overall costs of hospital care Inguinal herniorrhaphy is a common outpatient\r\n      surgical procedure with approximately 20 million operations performed worldwide annually.\r\n\r\n      Patients undergoing this procedure often experience moderate-to-severe pain, which can hinder\r\n      post anesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge. While pain can be treated with opioid therapy,\r\n      the literature supports that opioids may cause postoperative nausea, vomiting, hypoxia, and\r\n      urinary retention. In contrast, analgesia provided by regional block has been shown to\r\n      decrease the previous complications.\r\n\r\n      There is an ongoing interest in developing regional anesthetic techniques that may reduce or\r\n      eliminate the use of opioid analgesics after minor surgical procedures such as hernia repair.\r\n\r\n      Regional analgesia has found wide acceptance both by the patients and their treating\r\n      physicians, and therefore, it is now an important part of multimodal analgesia techniques.\r\n      Ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block(IINB),transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block,\r\n      paravertebral and rectus sheath, have all been used for providing analgesia following\r\n      abdominal surgeries .\r\n\r\n      The combined ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block (IINB) is a commonly used technique\r\n      for blockade of the ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric (IIIH) nerves and has been shown to decrease\r\n      pain after OIH as well as reduce opioid requirements.\r\n\r\n      Bupivacaine belongs to the amide family, and its structure is similar to that of lidocaine.\r\n      Bupivacaine is a potent agent capable of producing prolonged anesthesia. Its long duration of\r\n      action plus its tendency to provide more sensory than motor block has made it a popular drug\r\n      for providing prolonged analgesia during the postoperative period.\r\n\r\n      We assume that the use of higher concentration of bupivacaine in ilioinguinal and\r\n      iliohypogastric nerve block (IINB) might increase the efficacy of post-operative analgesia\r\n      and patient satisfaction.",

    "detailedSummary": "Speech entrainment refers to speaking in unison with a model speaker by imitating the model\r\n      in real time. The objective of the study is to (1) experimentally establish the direct effect\r\n      of speech entrainment practice on independent speech production post-treatment, and (2)\r\n      identify conditions that enhance treatment benefits.

Thus, the effect size for accurate power estimation is not\r\n      known. The strategy for this study is to optimize experimental sensitivity by maximizing the\r\n      number of observations per participants per condition within the constraints of feasibility.\r\n      The results from this study will provide critical information for evaluating the effect size\r\n      for a subsequent phase. Nevertheless, to estimate an optimal sample size, the investigators\r\n      leveraged the data from our Pilot Study, which examines the speech entrainment effect on\r\n      immediate performance rather than learning. With 13 participants, the investigators estimated\r\n      80% power to detect the effect of 0.8 (mean difference between groups divided by the pooled\r\n      standard deviation) observed in our pilot study for speaking with audiovisual speech\r\n      entrainment vs. independent speech (Aim 1). The calculation is based on a paired t-test with\r\n      an alpha of .05 (two-tailed) and a correlation of 0.5 between groups. With 24 participants,\r\n      there is 80% power to detect the observed effect of 0.6 for speaking with audiovisual speech\r\n      entrainment vs. auditory-only speech entrainment (alpha is set to .05, two-tailed,\r\n      correlation between groups is .57; Aim 2b). The investigators have substantially increased\r\n      the sample size (N=40) with the consideration that learning effects (the focus of the present\r\n      study) are expected to be smaller than performance effects (the focus of the Pilot Study).",

    "briefSummary": "Endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal lesions may prevent cancer. However, resection is associated with adverse events such as bleeding. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic derivative of lysine that exerts antifibrinolytic effects and may prevent bleeding. The investigators aim to evaluate the effect of local TXA on preventing intraprocedural and postprocedural bleeding in patients undergoing endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of upper gastrointestinal lesions.",
    "detailedSummary": "Endoscopic resection (ER) is an endoscopic technique used for the removal of sessile or flat\r\n      neoplasms confined to the superficial layers (mucosa and submucosa) of the gastrointestinal\r\n      (GI) tract.\r\n\r\n      This technique is not without risk, and clinically significant intraprocedural bleeding and\r\n      post-ER bleeding remain the most frequently encountered serious adverse event.\r\n\r\n      The bleeding rate associated with ER varies for the different regions of the GI tract. This\r\n      is most probably due to differences in the vascularity within the wall of the GI tract in\r\n      each region.\r\n\r\n      Intraprocedural bleeding in the stomach and duodenum is more frequent and may be as high as\r\n      11.5% and 19.3%, respectively. Delayed bleeding has been reported at about 5% for these\r\n      sites.\r\n\r\n      Management of bleeding is often resource intensive and may necessitate hospitalization, blood\r\n      transfusion, and repeat intervention. Some techniques, such as soft coagulation with the tip\r\n      of a snare; epinephrine injection; hemoclip placement or proton-pump inhibitor treatment, are\r\n      used to decrease the risk of bleeding or treat active bleeding.\r\n\r\n      Diluted epinephrine, which causes vasoconstriction, is often added to the submucosal\r\n      injection fluid because of the theoretical benefit of decreasing bleeding. However,\r\n      epinephrine has a short time-of-action and for long procedures it requires multiple doses to\r\n      be injected. This can result in systemic effects such as severe hypertension, ventricular\r\n      tachycardia, and intestinal ischemia, and may also increase postprocedural pain and prolong\r\n      patient observation after the procedure.\r\n\r\n      Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic derivative of lysine that exerts antifibrinolytic\r\n      effects by inhibition of lysine binding sites on plasminogen molecules and therefore\r\n      stabilizes the fibrin meshwork produced by secondary hemostasis. TXA was patented by Dr. S.\r\n      Okamoto in 1957, and it was found to be significantly more potent than a precursor molecule\r\n      known as epsilon-amino-caproic acid.\r\n\r\n      During the past few years, TXA has been 'rediscovered' and is currently used in many\r\n      conditions that are associated with either overt or occult hemorrhage. It is one of the most\r\n      frequently cited drugs in recent surgical publications involving nearly all surgical\r\n      specialties.\r\n\r\n      After the CRASH-2 study which showed that administration of TXA to bleeding trauma patients\r\n      within 3 hours of injury significantly reduced the risk of death due to bleeding and\r\n      all-cause mortality without increasing the risk of vascular occlusive events, it has become\r\n      an important part of trauma management.\r\n\r\n      It is also widely used in gynecological practice. Early treatment with TXA reduces death due\r\n      to bleeding in women with post-partum hemorrhage, as well as total blood loss and transfusion\r\n      requirements in hemorrhage after caesarean delivery. Therefore, TXA has been recommended by\r\n      the WHO as part of postpartum hemorrhage management.\r\n\r\n      TXA is also commonly used in orthopedic surgery, either systemically or topically, to reduce\r\n      excessive bleeding and transfusion requirements.\r\n\r\n      Other hemorrhagic conditions in which TXA has been shown effective are epistaxis, hemoptysis\r\n      , endoscopic ear surgery , mastectomy, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with\r\n      bleeding.\r\n\r\n      Topical use of TXA may be more beneficial than systemic use as it may provide a higher drug\r\n      concentration on the wound surface with negligible systemic concentrations. Most publications\r\n      concerning topically administered TXA come from orthopedic literature where instilling TXA as\r\n      a bolus into the joint reduces bleeding. Recently, a study revealed that intradermal\r\n      injections of TXA in dermatological surgery reduces bleeding, especially in those on\r\n      anticoagulant medications.\r\n\r\n      While TXA is an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, and therefore might theoretically increase the\r\n      risk of thrombotic vascular events, most studies show no increased risk of thromboembolism.\r\n      This finding has been consistent with all routes of TXA administration including IV,\r\n      topical/intra-articular, and other routes.\r\n\r\n      The most frequently described contraindications to TXA administration include patients with\r\n      histories of allergic reactions to TXA, seizures, and patients with acute renal failure or\r\n      chronic kidney disease.\r\n\r\n      We propose that the use of TXA in the injection gel during ER procedures will be as effective\r\n      as epinephrine usage in reducing intraprocedural and postprocedural bleeding, while also\r\n      decreasing the incidence of side effects including abdominal pain.",

    "briefSummary": "Sacrospinous ligament suspension (SSLS) was first described in 1958. It is commonly performed for correction of apical prolapse. A combination of delayed absorbable and/or permanent sutures are commonly used for the procedure. When permanent sutures are used, risk of suture-related complications is present and patients may require suture removal. In available literature, there is limited data comparing the efficacy and suture-related complications when using different types of sutures. A previous randomized controlled trial demonstrated that using an absorbable suture is equally efficacious as delayed absorbable sutures in SSLS. However, there is no comparison to absorbable versus permanent suture. Our aim is to compare the absorbable suture versus permanent suture for treating pelvic organ prolapse and to compare suture-related complications. Our primary outcome is comparing POPQ point C at 12 month follow up for absorbable vs permanent suture. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to absorbable or permanent suture. Follow up will occur at 2-4 weeks, 12 weeks and 12 months after the surgery.",

The use of it routinely is currently under discussion due to the morbidities associated with its use.",
    "detailedSummary": "LT has become in recent years a procedure with an increasing number of indications and with a\r\n      greater number of donations given the social knowledge of the donation process and donation\r\n      in controlled asystole. The Spanish Registry of Liver Transplantation (RETH) shows a total of\r\n      28,609 TH in the period 1986-2019, which represents an average of 867 TH per year in Spain.\r\n      These data place Spain among the first countries in terms of HT.\r\n\r\n      In LT, abdominal drainage has historically been used prophylactically as a way to identify\r\n      early intra-abdominal postoperative complications such as hemorrhage, bile leakage, and\r\n      others.\r\n\r\n      In transplant patients, the use of post-surgical abdominal drains on a routine basis has\r\n      shown an increase in total protein losses in patients with refractory ascites, an increase in\r\n      ascending infections secondary to drainage, infection and pain at the insertion point of the\r\n      drain, as well as as, an increase in hospital stay. Nor can a higher rate of postsurgical\r\n      bleeding and bile leakage be ruled out in patients with abdominal drainage.\r\n\r\n      Currently, in the few studies that there are in reference to the systematic use of abdominal\r\n      drains in lTH, the need for them prophylactically is being discussed as an early diagnosis of\r\n      postoperative intra-abdominal complications is not observed, but complications are seen to\r\n      increase secondary to drainage. Therefore, the need to use it systematically in all patients\r\n      is currently under discussion.\r\n\r\n      Currently, is facing an increase in ERAS\u24c7 (Enhanced Recovery After Surgey) programs, which\r\n      began in 2008 with colorectal surgery and are currently expanding to other surgical\r\n      procedures. These programs advocate reducing the number of drains and even not using them in\r\n      patients with a low risk of post-surgical complications.\r\n\r\n      In the current bibliography, the methodology of the studies is varied, with the majority\r\n      being non-randomized retrospective studies, which is why it is a subject that requires\r\n      studies with a better methodological design and a higher number of patients to obtain\r\n      conclusions of clinical relevance. that can set the direction in this area that is in\r\n      constant discussion.\r\n\r\n      Given the absence of any randomized non-inferiority clinical trial that studies the routine\r\n      use of abdominal drainage in the postoperative period of liver transplantation, consider that\r\n      it is necessary to carry it out to increase the evidence.\r\n\r\n      The number of HT performed in each center is limited and variable annually, which is why\r\n      consider that the best design for this clinical trial is a European multicenter.",

    "detailedSummary": "Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-driven lymphomas and diseases are associated with poor prognosis.\r\n      EBV proteins are recognized by T cells providing opportunities for EBV-specific T-cell\r\n      therapy. Recent findings show that early differentiated T cells (T memory stem cells, Tscm)\r\n      improve the prognosis in chronic viral diseases and are associated with effective tumor cell\r\n      killing in melanoma patients. Tscm might be superior to highly differentiated T cells because\r\n      of their longevity, robust proliferative potential, and capacity to reconstitute a wide\r\n      T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity. This project will test the hypothesis that Tscm are\r\n      efficacious for EBV-specific T-cell therapy. Clinical-grade enriched EBV-specific Tscm-CTLs\r\n      will be prepared and used to treat patients with primary EBV lymphomas, diseases or\r\n      post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) with limited other treatment options.",

    "detailedSummary": "The investigators designed a prospective, single-center, concealed allocation,\r\n      evaluator-blind, intention-to-treat, randomized control study.\r\n\r\n      Participants This study was at the respiratory care center of a hospital in Taiwan.\r\n      Individuals over 18 years of age, who used mechanical ventilation, were transferred from the\r\n      intensive care unit to the respiratory care center for mechanical ventilation weaning, and\r\n      were evaluated by a physician enrolled in the study. When a patient was eligible, the\r\n      physician would conduct further examinations to ensure the suitability and safety of the\r\n      participants, and the reasons for ineligibility for inclusion would be noted in the log.\r\n\r\n      Inclusion criteria:\r\n\r\n        1. Aged over 18 years, regardless of sex.\r\n\r\n        2. Use of mechanical ventilation and transfer from the intensive care unit to the\r\n           respiratory care center for weaning.\r\n\r\n        3. Stable vital signs.\r\n\r\n        4. Ability to understand simple instructions and agree to participate in this research\r\n           program after explanation.\r\n\r\n      Exclusion criteria:\r\n\r\n        1. Unconsciousness, severe cognitive impairment, or inability to follow instructions.\r\n\r\n        2. Severe heart failure (NYHA \u2265 3).\r\n\r\n        3. Diagnosis of terminal illness and undergoing palliative care.\r\n\r\n        4. Inability to receive exercise therapy due to physical conditions, fracture, lower limb\r\n           surgery, acute thrombosis, open wounds, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\r\n\r\n        5. Assessment by other attending physician that the participant's condition, progression of\r\n           disease course or treatment plan were not suitable for exercise therapy.\r\n\r\n      When the participants enrolled in the research, the trained research team members would\r\n      explain the objectives and methods of the research to ensure that the participants' consent\r\n      was fully informed. The participants had the right to withdraw from this research program at\r\n      any time. If a participant was unwilling to participate or withdrew, they were excluded from\r\n      this research program. A participant could only be enrolled after agreeing and signing the\r\n      consent form. A randomized clinical trial design was adopted in this study. The participants\r\n      were randomly divided into the experimental and control group in a one-to-one ratio. The\r\n      research assistant placed the number plate in an opaque and sealed envelope to ensure\r\n      concealed allocation. The order of allocation was randomized by the computer. The control\r\n      group underwent the routine mechanical ventilation weaning plan and hand bicycle training,\r\n      while the experimental group underwent the routine mechanical ventilation weaning plan and\r\n      continuous mobility training. Owing to the nature of the exercise intervention, it is\r\n      impossible to maintain blinding of the team members and participants. However, the physical\r\n      therapists who evaluated the main outcome were separated from those who performed the\r\n      therapy; thus, the evaluators were blinded. The content of the continuous mobility training\r\n      program depended on the evaluation results and the physical responses of the participants.\r\n      The treatment frequency of continuous mobility training was five times a week, once a day\r\n      from Monday to Friday.\r\n\r\n      Intervention content Control group: Participants of control group formed the routine care\r\n      group, received the routine mechanical ventilation weaning plan and underwent hand bicycle\r\n      training. The physicians assessed the participants and appropriately adjusted the settings of\r\n      the mechanical ventilation modules to gradually reduce the participants' dependence on\r\n      mechanical ventilation. Hand bicycle training was conducted by nurse practitioners once a\r\n      day. The participants' bedhead was raised, and the participants held the cycle ergometer with\r\n      both hands once they could tolerate upright positions for 15-20 minutes. Training intensity\r\n      was targeted at the level of symptom limitation, on the basis of a modified Borg scale rating\r\n      of 3-5. Intermittent and short-term periods of rest were allowed for participants to achieve\r\n      the goal of a total of 15-20 minutes exercise session.\r\n\r\n      Experimental group: Participants of the experimental group were given continuous mobility\r\n      training in addition to the routine mechanical ventilation weaning plan. The protocol was\r\n      divided into 5 levels - a modification from Dong et al. The physicians were responsible for\r\n      evaluating whether the participants had any contraindications before and during enrolment. If\r\n      any contraindication occurred at any time point, such as hypoxemia and other adverse events,\r\n      the treatment would be terminated immediately. The continuous mobility training would be\r\n      performed once a day from Monday to Friday. During the whole continuous mobility training\r\n      process, the exercise progress would be increased gradually, depending on the tolerance and\r\n      stability of the participants. The goal setting of each training exercise was that the\r\n      participants could undergo the training for 20 minutes continuously.\r\n\r\n      The continuous mobility training adopted grading exercise level, which was evaluated and\r\n      implemented by physical therapists, and focused on continuous mobility training courses with\r\n      different levels. At each stage, the participants were instructed to perform spontaneous\r\n      breathing exercise, which were confirmed by the physical therapists. In the first stage, the\r\n      participants' bedhead were raised, and the trunk were kept upright on the bed. In sitting\r\n      posture training, chest expansion training and deep breathing training was performed. The\r\n      training goal was that the participants should be able to sit in bed for at least 20 minutes,\r\n      and after training, the modified Borg scale rating of the participants should not exceed 7.\r\n      If the participants could successfully complete the first stage of the exercise training,\r\n      they would proceed to the next stage of exercise, and the training would be further upgraded\r\n      to assisting the participants to sit at the bedside in an upright posture and perform sitting\r\n      balance training. The physical therapists would provide minimal assistance or assistive\r\n      devices according to the participants' conditions. The goal was to achieve tolerance for 20\r\n      minutes continuously with a modified RPE not exceeding 7 and no contraindications. In the\r\n      third stage, the physical therapists would adopt appropriate strategies and assistive devices\r\n      according to the participants' abilities and move the participants to chairs. The fourth\r\n      stage was standing training. The participants could use assistive devices or other assistance\r\n      to stand. The fifth stage was marching on spot. All exercise training was guided by the\r\n      principle of maximum active participation of participants, with the goal of continuous\r\n      completion of body movements and spontaneous breathing movements.\r\n\r\n      Termination conditions of continuous mobility training: The training would be terminated\r\n      immediately if the participants had the following conditions:\r\n\r\n        1. Unstable vital signs: low blood oxygen concentration (SaO2 \u2264 90%) or shortness of breath\r\n           (total respiratory rate > 35 beats/min).\r\n\r\n        2. Arrhythmia.\r\n\r\n        3. Severe dizziness.\r\n\r\n        4. Changes in consciousness.\r\n\r\n        5. Assessment by attending physician that the participant's condition, progression of\r\n           disease course or treatment plan was not suitable for activities of exercise therapy.\r\n\r\n      After the intervention, the length of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the\r\n      respiratory care center, the success rate of mechanical ventilation weaning (weaning for more\r\n      than 5 days), the total length of hospital stay and adverse events of two groups were\r\n      recorded with evaluator-blind.\r\n\r\n      Data analysis All participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The mean,\r\n      standard deviation, and percentage of the participants' variables were used for descriptive\r\n      statistics. Comparative analysis between the experimental group and the control group was\r\n      performed according to all the effect variables. If the continuous variables conformed to\r\n      normal distribution according to Shapiro-Wilk test, they were expressed as mean\u00b1standard\r\n      deviation (mean\u00b1SD); otherwise, they were expressed as median (interquartile range).\r\n      Categorical variables were expressed as percentage.\r\n\r\n      The evaluation records of the two groups of participants were compared, and continuous\r\n      variables with normal distribution were compared by two sample independent t-test. When the\r\n      data were not normally distributed, Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the experimental\r\n      group with the control group. Chi-square test was used to evaluate the differences in the\r\n      categorical variables between the experimental group and the control group. To calculate the\r\n      sample size for duration of mechanical ventilation, the investigators based the design on\r\n      results found in Lai (2017) for a clinical trial. Considering a statistical power of 90% and\r\n      alpha error of 0.5, the investigators found that the number of subjects should be 9 per\r\n      group, totaling 18 participants. The statistical analysis software used was SPSS version\r\n      27.0, with 2-tailed p<.05 indicating statistical significance.",

The study contains two groups which will be compared. Control group: will do SVP implantation under local anaesthesia Study group: will do SVP implantation under local anaesthesia and patient-controlled sedation. The patients are asked to complete a questionnaire postoperatively which contains questions on pain perception and satisfaction.",
    "detailedSummary": "The study is an open multicentre randomized controlled trial with a study and a control arm\r\n      in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be randomized to either a control arm of LA for\r\n      SVP-implantation or a study arm of PCS with propofol and alfentanil as adjunct to LA for\r\n      SVP-implantation. The aim is to randomize 340 patients with an estimated patient recruitment\r\n      over 18 months with a following 6 months of data cleaning and analysis. The trial will be\r\n      performed at two centres; County Hospital Ryhov, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, Sweden and University Hospital\r\n      Link\u00f6ping, Sweden. SVP implantation procedure and perioperative time period is estimated to\r\n      2-4 hours. The primary endpoint is assessment of patients\u00b4 self-reported pain perception.\r\n      Secondary outcomes include patient satisfaction, implantation conditions, sedation level,\r\n      sedative and analgesic medication consumption, procedural time consumption as well as safety\r\n      aspects, adverse events and estimation of perioperative experience. Participation in the\r\n      trial ends after telephone inquiry one day postoperatively.\r\n\r\n      Control arm:\r\n\r\n      SVP-implantation in LA:\r\n\r\n      Subcutanous venous ports were introduced in 1981. A SVP is a small device around 3cm in\r\n      diameter with an injectable membrane buried just under the skin. It is connected to a thin\r\n      tube with its tip in a large bore vein. Access to the SVP is achieved by puncturing the skin\r\n      with a needle.\r\n\r\n      Local anaesthetic causes the absence of pain sensation in the location where applied by\r\n      decreasing the rate of depolarization and repolarization of excitable membranes such as\r\n      nociceptors and nerves. The most commonly used solutions are from the amide group differing\r\n      in pharmacokinetics. In order to reduce a burning sensation on infiltration substances can be\r\n      combined with sodium bicarbonate. There will be no restrictions in the choice of LA-solution\r\n      being left up to local practice at participating sites. With the beginning of the procedure\r\n      LA is subcutaneously applied to patients in both groups. LA used at participating centres are\r\n      Mepivacaine 10mg/ml, 20-40ml subcutaneously or Lidnocaine 10mg/ml, 20-40 ml subcutaneously.\r\n\r\n      Study arm:\r\n\r\n      SVP-implantation in LA and PCS:\r\n\r\n      In addition to LA, patients in the study group are able to self-administer a combination of\r\n      propofol and alfentanil using a patient-controlled sedation pump. The pump enables the\r\n      patient via a hand-held button to trigger the release of a single bolus of 0.5ml containing\r\n      4.5mg propofol and 25\u00b5g alfentanil under an 10 second period. This results in a maximal\r\n      possible amount of 6 bolus doses per minute.\r\n\r\n      Propofol is a short-acting anaesthetic agent commonly used for general anaesthesia and\r\n      procedural sedation. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed both through\r\n      potentiation of GABAA receptor activity and in higher doses behaving as GABAA receptor\r\n      agonist. When used for intravenous sedation a single dose wears off within minutes demanding\r\n      for continuous or intermittent application.\r\n\r\n      Alfentanil is a short-acting synthetic opioid analgesic agent with rapid onset of effects at\r\n      \u00b5-opioid receptors. These properties make it suitable to provide analgesia for brief\r\n      procedures and to infuse for longer procedures and yet provide relatively rapid recovery.\r\n\r\n      Rescue sedation will be available to patients in both groups on the patient\u00b4s or operator\u00b4s\r\n      demand. Rescue sedation consists of propofol and alfentanil administered by the clinician and\r\n      is documented in the e-CRF.\r\n\r\n      Setting:\r\n\r\n      This trial will be carried out in the following anaesthesia departments:\r\n\r\n      OP/IVA clinic, County Hospital Ryhov, Sweden AnOpIVA clinic, University Hospital Link\u00f6ping,\r\n      Sweden\r\n\r\n      Participants will be instructed on use of the PCS pump (Syramed \u00b5SP6000, Arcomed AG,\r\n      Switzerland) by a nurse anesthetist. The syringe is loaded with 36 ml propofol (10 mg/ml) and\r\n      4 ml alfentanil (0.5 mg/ml). Each time the patient presses the handheld button, an aliquot of\r\n      0.5 ml is injected (4.5 mg propofol/0.025 mg alfentanil). The injection time is set to 10 s,\r\n      restricting self-administration to a maximum of 6 bolus doses per minute corresponding to 27\r\n      mg propofol and 0.15 mg alfentanil per minute. No lockout period is applied. Local\r\n      anaesthesia is injected in the operating site. Vital parameters prior to the procedure are\r\n      recorded. Patients are monitored using electrocardiography for heartrate (HR), non-invasive\r\n      blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation (SpO2), and respiratory rate (RR) at 5-min intervals\r\n      during the procedure. Bradycardia is defined as HR <40 beats/min, tachycardia as HR >100\r\n      beats/min, hypotension as systolic BP < 90 mmHg or a decrease of >30% from baseline, hypoxia\r\n      as SpO2 <90% or a decrease of >5% from baseline, and bradypnea as RR of <8 breaths per\r\n      minute. Supplemental oxygen via a capnograph-fitted nasal cannula is administered to all\r\n      patients at 2 L/min during the procedure. The Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation\r\n      score (OAA/S) [9] is used to determine the sedation level during the four procedural steps:\r\n      1) sterile swabbing, 2) injection of LA, 3) catheter tunneling, and 4) sterile drape removal.\r\n      The operating anesthesiologist assesses the operating conditions on a 4 point scale with 1\r\n      enabling the operator to perform the procedure without time delay and 4 having to abort the\r\n      procedure. Puncture attempt is defined as continuous needle advancement to establish vein\r\n      puncture. An unvalidated patient perception assessment tool with seven dimensions applying\r\n      the NRS is used to evaluate patient perception. QoR-15 will be measured att 3 timepoints.\r\n      Preoperatively, postoperatively before patient discharge and one day postoperatively.",

    "briefSummary": "It has been shown in previous studies that burst suppression has an effect on the development of postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). With the development of technology, EEG-based anesthesia management is getting more and more attention. In particular, methods that reduce anesthetic drug consumption are expected to prevent POD and POCD by reducing burst suppression. There are studies that show that epidural analgesia applications reduce general anesthesia drug consumption in patients receiving general anesthesia. In this study, investigators want to investigate the effect of epidural analgesia combined with general anesthesia on burst suppression. POD and POCD development in these patients will be examined as secondary objectives.",
    "detailedSummary": "Postoperative delirium (POD) is an acute cognitive disorder characterized by inattention,\r\n      disorganized thinking, and a fluctuating course that develops over hours or days. Although\r\n      delirium depends on the type of surgery, it is a common postoperative complication with an\r\n      incidence of 10%-70%. POD causes an increase in mortality, morbidity and health care costs.\r\n      Risk factors for POD; age, type and duration of surgery, inadequate pain control, type of\r\n      anesthesia, anemia, transfusion, and preoperative cognitive impairment. In recent years, it\r\n      has been emphasized that POD can be reduced with the widespread use of electroencephalogram\r\n      (EEG) based anesthesia management and optimization of anesthetic drugs according to EEG\r\n      patterns. EEG consists of 6 waveforms: slow, delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma. Behavioral\r\n      and neurophysiological patterns caused by anesthetic drugs are associated with different\r\n      electroencephalogram waveforms. Recent developments in the introduction of EEG-based monitors\r\n      have made significant contributions to the understanding of the fundamental changes in brain\r\n      activity caused by anesthetic agents. Today, there are EEG-based anesthesia depth monitors\r\n      such as bispectral index (BIS) (Medtronic, USA) or Sedline (Masimo Irvine CA). These monitors\r\n      make it easier to optimize the depth of anesthesia with the numerical data obtained as a\r\n      result of some calculations as well as the raw EEG. The burst suppression (BS) pattern on the\r\n      EEG shows a decrease in brain neuronal activity and metabolic activity. Burst suppression can\r\n      be induced by anesthetic drugs that modulate \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. Although\r\n      sometimes deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes to treat refractory status\r\n      epilepticus or increased intracranial pressure, burst suppression is generally considered\r\n      potentially harmful and should be avoided.Studies conducted in recent years have shown the\r\n      relationship between intraoperative burst suppression (BS) and POD. POD; It can be reduced by\r\n      continuous EEG monitoring, reducing the dose of propofol, preferring regional anesthesia,\r\n      effective postoperative pain control, early mobilization, and early postoperative discharge.\r\n      Interventions that can reduce the development of postoperative delirium will be important for\r\n      public health. Epidural analgesia can be used effectively in perioperative analgesia. It has\r\n      been reported in the literature that epidural analgesia combined with general anesthesia\r\n      reduces the amount of hypnotic drug required to achieve similar depth of anesthesia compared\r\n      to general anesthesia alone. There is no study in the literature on whether the combination\r\n      of epidural analgesia and general anesthesia reduces BS in EEG-based anesthesia applications.\r\n      Our primary aim in this study is to evaluate whether the combination of general anesthesia\r\n      and epidural analgesia reduces BS in EEG-based anesthesia in patients undergoing total hip\r\n      and knee arthroplasty.",

    "briefSummary": "Aging of the neuromuscular system may lead to an increased risk of falls in older adults. There are external and internal factors for falls, and lower limb muscle strength and balance are important internal factors for falls in the elderly. And can be improved through exercise. Therefore, an important interventional goal in interventional exercises to prevent falls in the elderly is to promote balance and increase lower extremity muscle strength. Flexi-bar is a device that provides vibration stimulation. Studies have shown that a 5Hz frequency can be generated when shaken and transmitted to the whole body. Flexi bar is now widely used in fitness centers or rehabilitation therapy to improve muscle strength and balance. Vibration activates the tonic reflex, enhances the excitability of alpha and gamma motor neurons and enhances motor unit synchronization, and this active vibration training helps increase muscle coordination as it induces the tonic reflex and stimulates the proprioception of the joint Feelings, these physiological changes can lead to more effective proprioceptive feedback that improves balance. And because the vibration causes the agonist and antagonist muscles to contract alternately to regulate the instability during the movement. In recreational athletes, the use of a flexi bar in a single-legged position can effectively induce lower extremity muscle activation. A 12-week combination of balance and strength training in older adults has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of falls in older adults in previous studies. Since the effect of adding Flexi bar on the basis of balance and strength training is unknown, the purpose of this study was to investigate the experimental group and the control group with the same exercise posture and training time, Flexi bar + BST Is it better for the balance and muscle strength of the elderly than simple BST?",

    "briefSummary": "In Uganda, Youth living with HIV/AIDS (YLHIVA) enrolled in HIV treatment experience suboptimal treatment adherence and have lower viral load suppression (VLS) rates compared to younger children or adults. VLS is essential in reducing AIDS related morbidity and mortality yet AIDS-related deaths remain high among YLHIVA. To improve these poor outcomes, there has been an effort by Ministry of Health Uganda (MoH) to prioritize and scale up new adolescent and youth-targeted models of service delivery. \"Peer support\" increasingly forms part of adolescent and youth-responsive service packages as a class of implementation strategies that can support adolescents to access, engage, and sustain treatment. However, peer support activities in Uganda occur face to face at health care settings(2). This approach presents structural limitations such as the need to travel or schedule an appointment, inconvenient working hours and inadequate safe space for peer support activities. Thus, peer support services may not be readily available at the time when youth need them. With the rapid increase in mobile phone availability among Ugandan youth, online peer support groups (PSGs) have the potential to help YLHIVA access regular support without significant effort or cost. The rollout of online PSGs among YLHIVA in Uganda requires evidence on there acceptability feasibility and effectiveness. Aim: The aim of this study is to explore a WhatsApp peer support group as a strategy to improve ART adherence care among youth aged 15-24 years in Kampala district. Methods: The study will use a mixed methods approach. It will be conducted in two phases; first a formative phase to refine the aspects of the WhatsApp peer support group. These findings will then guide the design and implementation of the second phase; an RCT to assess the acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of WhatsApp PSG as strategy to improve ART adherence among YLHIVA in Kampala. The RCT is a multicentre, open label assessor-blind, with balanced randomisation (1:1) parallel group superiority trial. Study participants randomized to the control arm will remain on the current standard of care only, while those in the intervention arm will be enrolled on a WhatsApp PSG and receive the current standard. Data will be collected using structured questionnaires, Key Informant Interviews, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Quantitative data will be analysed using summary statistics, logistic regression models, generalized linear models and Generalized Estimating Equations while for the qualitative verbatim transcription and thematic analysis will be used. Utility: The study findings will help to advance the knowledge on virtual support as a peer support model in Uganda.",
    "detailedSummary": "Adolescents and young people living with HIV (AYPLHIV) account for 45% of new HIV infections\r\n      globally, with 70% of this population residing in sub-Saharan Africa. In Sub-Saharan Africa\r\n      (SSA), 37% of youth living with HIV/AIDS (YLHIVA) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) have viral\r\n      load suppression (VLS). This is way below the UNAIDS target of 95% VLS. VLS reduces mortality\r\n      rate and the risk of HIV transmission. In Uganda, only 44.9% of female and 32.5% male youth\r\n      aged 15 to 24 years have VLS. ART adherence is essential in achieving VLS. However, in\r\n      Uganda, ART adherence is suboptimal among the youth (67% -87%) and is lower compared to other\r\n      age groups.\r\n\r\n      The sub-optimal ART adherence among YLHIVA result from complex personal, interpersonal, and\r\n      contextual challenges. Among these challenges are the psychosocial barriers exacerbated by\r\n      the social cognitive development changes that occur during adolescence and young adulthood.\r\n      Social acceptance is more critical for this age group than any other, yet many YLHIVA\r\n      experience stigma and bulling, leading to negative self-images, low self-efficacy, anxiety\r\n      and depression. Depressed YLHIVA are more likely to abuse alcohol and drugs. World Health\r\n      Organisation (WHO) and Ministry Of Health Uganda (MoH) recommend peer support groups to offer\r\n      psychosocial support to YLHIVA. However, in Uganda and most Sub-Saharan countries, peer\r\n      support group activities occur face-to-face and often in health facilities . This approach\r\n      presents structural limitations such as the need to travel, inconvenient working hours and\r\n      inadequate safe space for psychosocial services. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has worsened\r\n      this situation; social distancing requires more space and curfew hours limit the time for\r\n      providing psychosocial services. Thus, these psychosocial services may not be available at\r\n      the time when youth need them and hence the need for more real-time and widely feasible\r\n      interventions.\r\n\r\n      With the rapid increase in mobile phone availability in SSA, online peer support groups have\r\n      the potential to help YLHIVA access regular support without significant effort or cost . In\r\n      Uganda, 60.7% of youth own a mobile phone, 90% use their phone to call, 87.9% use them for\r\n      social media and 64% use their phones for text messaging. Text messaging and phone call\r\n      interventions have showed improved ART adherence but these function to automate individual\r\n      level cues to action. Social media platforms permit virtual communities and can serve as a\r\n      place for peer support group activities. However, it is not clear what is the best way to\r\n      create online peer support groups in m-Health interventions, either through integration into\r\n      established social media platforms or developing \"new\" social media platforms. \"New\" social\r\n      media platforms have an advantage of broad complement functionality, but these need time to\r\n      develop and phones that are more advanced not readily available in low income setting like\r\n      Uganda. Besides concerns about stigma associated with mobile apps developed for HIV-positive\r\n      people may make them unacceptable in communities where HIV is stigmatised . In low-income\r\n      settings, peer support groups integrated into established social media platforms may be more\r\n      feasible. Established social media platforms used to offer peer support among People Living\r\n      with HIV/AIDS (PLWHIVA) include we chat, WhatsApp, Weibo in China and Facebook. Youth largely\r\n      use Facebook to connect with their peers, but impression management is a major challenge\r\n      among young Facebook users. This might be exacerbated among YLHIVA as they struggle with\r\n      self-images. In a recent study conducted in south Africa, YLHIVA expressed preference for\r\n      online peer support groups integrated into established social media platforms which use\r\n      minimal data such as WhatsApp. Further more recent research on m-Health interventions for\r\n      youth, have stressed the need for multifaceted approaches. These include; provision of\r\n      credible, up-to-date information on HIV and general health and wellness, reminders that focus\r\n      on ART adherence, those that ease connections to providers and other YLHIVA . WhatsApp offers\r\n      the flexibility needed for the multifaceted m- health approach and permits virtual\r\n      communities for peer support groups. WhatsApp documents and videos features offer an avenue\r\n      for group education. WhatsApp calls and texts ease direct connections to providers, thus\r\n      enhancing real-time engagement to receive individualized support. In addition, the public\r\n      uses WhatsApp and so they may not refer to it as an \"HIV App\".\r\n\r\n      There is growing evidence that online peer support groups improve psychosocial outcomes, ART\r\n      adherence and VLS among PLHIVA . However, majority of the studies have been conducted among\r\n      key populations and very few have examined its benefits among YLHIVA. Among YLHIVA in the US,\r\n      an online peer support group improved VLS from 64.1% to 91.4% and ART adherence (90.1% vs\r\n      57.5% at eight weeks follow-up; difference=31.1, p=.02). On the other hand, in SSA no\r\n      significant improvements in ART adherence were observed among youth enrolled into online peer\r\n      support groups. However, these studies had limited sample size and short follow-up periods.\r\n      Given the mixed results, further evidence on the effectiveness of online peer support groups\r\n      in improving HIV treatment outcomes among YLHIVA in SSA is required.\r\n\r\n      In Sub-Saharan Africa, qualitative work has underscored the psychosocial benefits of online\r\n      peer support groups for YLHIVA. Youth have reported that online peer support groups reduced\r\n      isolation, increased self-esteem, helped them to sustain efforts towards healthy living and\r\n      work through the everyday struggles of ART adherence .Youth have described online peer\r\n      support group as a safe and private community where one could be understood and valued.\r\n      Furthermore, online peer support groups have improved HIV knowledge but their effect on HIV\r\n      stigma among YLHIVA in SSA remains unknown. Yet stigma attached to HIV is believed to\r\n      underpin many of the social, cultural, and psychological barriers to ART adherence.\r\n      Furthermore, a meta-analysis by Ninke and colleagues, showed that ART adherence was strongly\r\n      related to adherence self-efficacy. Therefore, the effect of online peer support groups on\r\n      adherence self-efficacy needs to be understood. In addition, previous studies found that\r\n      youth with HIV on online support groups felt helpless when group members posted suicidal\r\n      thoughts. Such discussions are associated with increased depression, though online peer\r\n      support groups have shown decreased depression among youth with mental problems. The effect\r\n      of online peer support groups on depression among YLHIVA remains unknown and there is need\r\n      further investigation in this area.\r\n\r\n      The utility of online peer support groups has potential to improve ART adherence among YLHIVA\r\n      in Uganda. Thus, the aim of this study is to explore a WhatsApp peer support group as a\r\n      strategy to improve ART adherence among youth aged 15-24 years in Kampala district. The study\r\n      findings will help to advance the knowledge on virtual support as a peer support model in\r\n      sub-Saharan Africa. The social cognitive theory will guide the study to capture the complex\r\n      psychosocial profiles of youth ART adherence and retention in care.",

    "detailedSummary": "Anesthesia is a controlled, temporary loss of sensation or awareness used to perform surgical\r\n      procedures. Spinal anesthesia is commonly used in obstetrics and gynecology for vaginal\r\n      procedures as well as cesarean sections. The use of spinal anesthesia for laparoscopic\r\n      surgery is an adequate and safe alternative to general anesthesia which remains the gold\r\n      standard. Vaginal Natural Orifice Endoscopic Surgery (vNOTES) is a minimally invasive\r\n      laparoscopic approach used for tubal sterilization that is currently performed under general\r\n      anesthesia. This study is proposing that spinal anesthesia is an adequate and safe\r\n      alternative to general anesthesia for vNOTES tubal sterilization. If participants join the\r\n      study, all other routine care will continue but the researchers will randomly assign\r\n      participants, like flipping a coin, to one of two groups. Both types of anesthesia are\r\n      commonly used but the researchers are doing this study because it is not known if spinal\r\n      anesthesia is a better alternative than general anesthesia which is typically used. The goal\r\n      is to find out what might be best for future patients. If it turns out the two types of\r\n      anesthesia are about the same, then surgeons would know that choosing the type with fewer\r\n      side effects still gives satisfactory results and allows for this surgery to be performed\r\n      safely. The risks involved in participating in this study are the same as all other\r\n      anesthetic and surgical procedures which have significant physical risks. If participants\r\n      choose to enroll, there will be a 50/50 chance of being assigned to either the standard of\r\n      care group which will receive general anesthesia or the experimental group which will receive\r\n      spinal anesthesia. Benefits cannot be guaranteed but, It is possible participants could be\r\n      assigned to a type of anesthesia that has fewer side effects.",

Two\r\n      groups (a) ONS + exercise programme and (b) exercise programme alone will begin the\r\n      intervention within one month of screening, complete the 12-week intervention and be\r\n      reassessed after a further 12 weeks. The other two groups (c) ONS + exercise programme and\r\n      (d) exercise programme alone will be assessed at week 0 and will begin the intervention 12 to\r\n      16 weeks later. Nutritional status will be reassessed to determine if any changes to\r\n      nutritional status have occurred between screening and commencing the intervention. The\r\n      staggered start group will then begin the intervention and complete the intervention after\r\n      twelve weeks.",

Both drug concentrations are tested for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has approved semaglutide in prefilled pen-injector form. Currently, the drug concentration of 1.34 mg/ml can be prescribed in some countries including U.S. The objective of the study is to compare the amount of investigational drug taken up in the body for the 2 drug concentrations. Participants will be divided by chance into 2 groups. Group A will receive a single dose of 0.5 mg semaglutide of the drug concentration 1.34 mg/mL in the first study period; and will receive a single dose of 0.5 mg semaglutide of the drug concentration 0.68 mg/mL in the second study period. Participants assigned to group B will receive the two drug concentrations in the reverse order. Participants will get 1 subcutaneous injection on Day 1 of each of the two study periods. The two injections are separated by 7-11 weeks. The study will last up to approximately 87 to 141 days for each participant. This includes a screening period (up to 4 weeks), study period 1 (5 weeks), washout period (2-6 weeks), and study period 2 (5 weeks). At some periods during the study, participant should not get vaccinations. Participant should agree on timing of vaccination with study doctor.

    "detailedSummary": "Patients with COVID-19 may develop severe illness characterized by progressive hypoxic\r\n      respiratory failure, resulting in the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Reducing the\r\n      rate of endotracheal intubation in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure can be\r\n      beneficial to the prognosis, economize iatrical resources and reduce sanitary investment.\r\n      Some studies have shown that prone positioning can improve oxygenation to some extent in\r\n      patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation due to severe ARDS.\r\n\r\n      Whether awake prone positioning can reduce endotracheal intubation and mortality in COVID-19\r\n      patients with hypoxic respiratory failure is still controversial. A meta-analysis found that\r\n      the awake prone positioning was safe and feasible to reduce the risk of intubation or death.\r\n      However, the multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted by Alhazzani et al\r\n      pointed out that the awake prone positioning group did not significantly reduce the rate of\r\n      endotracheal intubation when compared with the standard of care.\r\n\r\n      Some researchers thought the time of prone positioning is an important factor for the\r\n      different results. In previous studies, the median duration of prone positioning was only\r\n      4.8-5 hours per day but some guidelines recommend the duration should be more than 8 hours.\r\n      Therefore, increasing patient adherence in the awake prone positioning and extending prone\r\n      positioning time are of great importance.\r\n\r\n      Awake timed prone and repositioning is a novel method proposed in recent years, which can\r\n      improve patients' compliance and prolong the time of treatment. This study intends to ask\r\n      whether awake timed prone and repositioning could impact the intubation rate and prognosis of\r\n      unincubated patients with hypoxic respiratory failure induced by COVID-19.",

At present, the commonly used methods are the\r\n      intravenous injection of propofol, etomidate, ketamine, and other drugs to make the patient's\r\n      unconscious. The disadvantage is that the patient cannot cooperate during the examination\r\n      (e.g., for changing position), and medical staff is needed to assist in turning over the\r\n      patient, if necessary. This may compress the patient's stomach and abdomen, which may cause\r\n      gastric reflux and aspiration, which may cause pneumonia, with morbidity and even mortality.\r\n      Nalbuphine hydrochloride is a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid with a duration of action of\r\n      approximately 3-6 hours. It is chemically related to both the agonist analgesic oxymorphone\r\n      and the antagonist naloxone, and acts as an antagonist at the \u03bc receptor and as an agonist at\r\n      the \u03ba receptor, resulting in analgesia and sedation with minimal effects in the\r\n      cardiovascular system. Any slight RD that occurs would be restricted by a ceiling effect.\r\n      Dexmedetomidine, a new drug, is highly selective \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist. It possesses\r\n      hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, sympatholytic, and analgesic properties without producing\r\n      significant respiratory depression. It also reduces both anesthetic and opioid analgesic\r\n      requirements during the perioperative period.

(The\r\n      one-month follow-up shall understand participants' perception and receptivity of alcohol\r\n      marketing and drinking behavior due to alcohol marketing exposure and alcohol consumption.)\r\n\r\n      Subjects\r\n\r\n      The investigators will recruit 360 participants with the following inclusion criteria: (1)\r\n      aged between 18 and 35 years, (2) own a mobile smartphone with internet access, (3) drank any\r\n      alcohol in past 30 days (current drinkers), (4) will be in Hong Kong during the 3-week EMA\r\n      study period, and (5) able to read and write in Chinese.\r\n\r\n      Procedures\r\n\r\n      Recruitment strategy\r\n\r\n      A mass email containing the study information will be sent to all undergraduate and\r\n      postgraduate HKU students and staff for recruitment with up to three email reminders\r\n      describing the research. Also, online recruitment advertisements will be posted in different\r\n      online discussion boards that Hong Kong university students usually visit. Voluntary\r\n      participants can directly contact our recruitment staff via telephone, email, or submitting\r\n      the online application form for a subsequent briefing meeting. Our pilot study has shown that\r\n      these methods are feasible to recruit a large number of interested participants. After\r\n      participants registered online, they will be re-directed to a web link for eligibility\r\n      screening. Research assistant shall contact eligible participants for instructions on the\r\n      consent form, baseline questionnaire and guidance on installing the EMA app and further\r\n      usage.\r\n\r\n      EMA App\r\n\r\n      After the participant gives consent and completes the baseline questionnaire, a trained\r\n      research assistant will install an EMA App on the participant's smartphone, and give\r\n      instructions on using the App. The App will be developed for both iOS and Android platforms\r\n      to administer the regular EMAs automatically. To protect the privacy of the participants, no\r\n      personal information (e.g., names and telephone numbers) will be collected by the App. Only a\r\n      5-digit case number will be used for identification. Unless otherwise specified, the case\r\n      number will be the last five digits of the subject's phone number. Once the App is\r\n      successfully installed, the user will be asked to choose a start date for the 21 consecutive\r\n      days study period within the coming three weeks and to set up a lunch hour between 11:00 am\r\n      and 4:00pm in these study days to undertake the regularly prompting EMA.\r\n\r\n      On each study day, the App will regularly prompt the participants to complete a questionnaire\r\n      about their recent exposure to alcohol advertisements in different channels every 5 hours for\r\n      a total of three times that approximately match the time of lunch, dinner and before sleep at\r\n      night, and alcohol consumption. Existing meta-analysis on the compliance rate of EMA studies\r\n      found that among nonclinical studies with participants consists of the youth population, the\r\n      highest average compliance rate was observed in studies that prompted the questionnaire 2-3\r\n      times daily (91.7%) compared with more frequent prompts of 4-5 times (77.4%) or 6+ times\r\n      (75.0%)45. This meta-analysis also showed that the 3-week length of EMA yielded the highest\r\n      compliance rate (84.0%) compared with 1-week (75.8%) and 2-week (76.8%) length. The 21-day\r\n      time period was also the average number of days (SD = 28; range of 2 to 175) of assessment\r\n      based on previous systematic reviews examining EMA studies on substance abuse46.\r\n\r\n      Moreover, as alcohol consumption tends to occur late at night, it is also important to\r\n      capture the drinking behavior within the full range of participants' waking hours. Therefore,\r\n      the first EMA at each afternoon shall record the hang-over effects from the previous night's\r\n      drinking47 and the last EMA would capture the drinking behavior that mostly would happen48.\r\n      For example, if a participant gets up late from hang-over and sets the lunch hour to 1:00 pm,\r\n      he/she will be asked to complete an EMA survey at 1:00 pm, 6:00 pm and 11:00 pm on that day.\r\n      Each EMA survey will take about 1 minute to complete (the last EMA of each day may last 2\r\n      minutes). If the user cannot respond to the EMA survey prompt immediately, he/she could\r\n      respond to the EMA prompt within 30 mins in two further reminders at 15 mins and 5 mins. Each\r\n      prompt not responded to for 30 minutes will be regarded as a non-response. All the above\r\n      data, including the date and time of completing the EMA survey and responses to the prompts,\r\n      will be sent to our server immediately for further analysis.\r\n\r\n      Randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding\r\n\r\n      All eligible participants will be randomly assigned to control or intervention groups using a\r\n      random sequence generated by an online sampling randomizer. Before the participants' consent,\r\n      the group allocation was concealed for both participants and interviewers. All participants\r\n      and interviewers at baseline and 1-month follow-up are not blinded.\r\n\r\n      Follow-up\r\n\r\n      To minimize the survey effect of EMA on the study outcomes, a telephone follow-up to assess\r\n      the study outcomes will be conducted 1 month after the completion of the EMA. The survey\r\n      included the outcomes of drinking normalization, alcohol consumption level, and their\r\n      satisfaction level regarding the baseline survey, mobile App, EMA surveys, follow-up survey,\r\n      and the overall rating of the study.\r\n\r\n      Data analyses\r\n\r\n      Data analysis will be conducted using STATA (version 15). All significance tests were\r\n      two-sided with a 5% level of significance. The internal consistency of the constructs for\r\n      perceived popularity, perceived social approval and positive expectancy will be assessed with\r\n      Cronbach's alpha. In each construct, the investigators will sum all items to build the score\r\n      for that attribute in each participant. The investigators will create a composite measure of\r\n      receptivity by averaging or summing the 5 items of receptivity documented in the EMAs in each\r\n      participant.\r\n\r\n      For the 1st research question, independent t-test/ Mann-Whitney U test will be used to test\r\n      the difference of compliance rate for EMA survey between groups. Data will present as mean \u00b1\r\n      standard deviation (SD).\r\n\r\n      For 2nd to 6th questions, the investigators will use multiple linear regression model to\r\n      assess the exposure frequency to alcohol marketing on the three attributes of participants'\r\n      normalization of drinking (the 2nd research question), and alcohol consumption (the 3rd\r\n      research question). Multiple linear regression model will also be used to assess the\r\n      association between receptivity to alcohol marketing and drinking normalization (the 5th\r\n      research question). Multilevel modeling will be used to answer the second question to explore\r\n      the influence of exposure frequency to alcohol marketing on receptivity to alcohol marketing\r\n      (the 4th research question), and the association between receptivity to alcohol marketing and\r\n      alcohol consumption (the 6th research question).\r\n\r\n      Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) will be adopted to explore factor structure of perceived\r\n      popularity, perceived social approval, and positive expectancy (the 7th research question).\r\n      The investigators will use Bartlett test of sphericity and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure\r\n      of sampling adequacy to do the correlation test. If the P value of bartlett test less than\r\n      0.05 and KMO value large than 0.5, factors will be used for further analysis. In principal\r\n      component analysis, factors with eigenroots greater than 1 will retain. Varimax will be used\r\n      to factor rotation. Items with factor coefficients of greater than or equal to 0.5 were\r\n      required for interpretation of factor structures. Inter-item reliability was assessed by\r\n      Cronbach's \u03b1. Accordingly, Cronbach's \u03b1 of greater than 0.7 was considered to be an\r\n      acceptable reliability coefficient of the scale.\r\n\r\n      To answer the 8th research question, structural equation modeling will be adopted to examine\r\n      the pathways of exposure frequency and receptivity to alcohol marketing, perceived\r\n      popularity, perceived social approval, and alcohol consumption level. The model will be\r\n      adjusted for participants' age and sex. For within-subject effects, the investigators will\r\n      lag the data to prevent occurrence effect if the participants were exposed to alcohol\r\n      marketing when purchasing alcohol. The investigators will include the exposure to alcohol\r\n      marketing reported in the index reports (t0) to predict the subsequent report of alcohol\r\n      consumption. The elapsed time between index (t0) and subsequent reports will be included as a\r\n      level-1 (within-subject) covariate. Autocorrelation will be detected and controlled for in\r\n      the model. Bootstrapping with size 10,000 will be used to estimate the 95% confidence\r\n      interval of the parameters. After checking data distribution normality, several fit indices\r\n      will be served as the judgement of the fit of the model. A non-significant chi-square (X2) is\r\n      desired, but the test is sensitive to erroneously reject a correct model when the sample size\r\n      is not large enough.57 The Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and the Non-Normal Fit Index (also\r\n      known as the Tucker-Lewis Index), ranging from 0.00 to 1.00, with higher values representing\r\n      better fit, will be adopted.58 The standardized root-mean-square residual will be used to\r\n      detect model misspecifications, with values below 0.08 considered desirable.58 The indirect\r\n      effect of the model will be checked with Sobel test. Similar model will be conducted to\r\n      detect between-subject effects.",

    "detailedSummary": "Background: Central nervous system (CNS) active medications have been consistently linked to\r\n      falls in older people. However, few randomized trials have evaluated whether CNS-active\r\n      medication reduction reduces falls and fall-related injuries. The objective of the Reducing\r\n      CNS-active Medications to Prevent Falls and Injuries in Older Adults (STOP-FALLS) trial is to\r\n      test the effectiveness of a health-system-embedded deprescribing intervention focused on\r\n      CNS-active medications on the incidence of medically treated falls among community-dwelling\r\n      older adults.\r\n\r\n      We will conduct a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, parallel-group, controlled clinical trial\r\n      within Kaiser Permanente Washington to test the effectiveness of a 12-month deprescribing\r\n      intervention consisting of: 1) an educational brochure and self-care handouts mailed to older\r\n      adults prescribed one or more CNS-active medications (aged 60+: opioids, benzodiazepines and\r\n      Z-drugs; aged 65+: skeletal muscle relaxants, tricyclic antidepressants, and antihistamines)\r\n      and 2) decision support for their primary health care providers. Outcomes are examined over\r\n      18-26 months post-intervention. The primary outcome is first incident (post-baseline)\r\n      medically treated fall as determined from health plan data. Our sample size calculations\r\n      ensured at least 80% power to detect a 20% reduction in the rate of medically treated falls\r\n      for participants receiving care within the intervention (n=9) versus usual care clinics (n=9)\r\n      assuming 18 months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes include medication discontinuation or\r\n      dose reduction of any target medications. Safety outcomes include serious adverse drug\r\n      withdrawal events, unintentional overdose, and death. We will also examine medication\r\n      signetur fields for attempts to decrease medications. We will report factors affecting\r\n      implementation of the intervention.",

    "detailedSummary": "In this study, 60 adhesive capsulitis with age range 18-65 who applied to K\u0131rsehir Ahi Evran\r\n      University Training and Research Hospital were examined.Adhesive capsulitis is also called\r\n      arthrofibrosis, which involves excessive adhesion formation along the glenohumeral joint. It\r\n      is a disease of unknown etiology and is classified as primary and secondary. Primary adhesive\r\n      capsulitis includes cases of idiopathic origin resulting from chronic inflammation with\r\n      fibroblast proliferation. Secondary adhesive capsulitis, central nervous system involvement,\r\n      arm immobilized for a long time, trauma or fracture, infectious diseases, etc. Includes\r\n      post-mortem situations.\r\n\r\n      Adhesive capsulitis progression is characterized by four stages, each stage presenting a\r\n      distinctive clinical picture.\r\n\r\n      low-level laser therapy supports cell proliferation and tissue regeneration with its\r\n      anti-inflammatory and photobiostimulation properties.The pressure waves of ESWT pass through\r\n      fluids and soft tissues and exert their effects in areas of impedance change such as bones\r\n      and soft tissue spaces. These waves have mechanical and cellular effects. The most important\r\n      of these effects are temporary damage to the neuronal cell membrane or increased\r\n      permeability. These mechanisms may facilitate neovascularization and cellular regeneration in\r\n      tissues.",

    "briefSummary": "It is widely known that exercise creates structural and functional changes in the brain. Synaptic plasticity develops through exercise, thus improving brain functions. It is suggested that skeletal muscle contraction and peripheral signal molecules secreted from various tissues, especially skeletal muscle, contribute to exercise's effect on the brain's structure and function. These signals synthesized and released from skeletal muscle are called myokines. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Cathepsin B are two of these myokines, which have been reported to cross the blood-brain barrier following secretion in the periphery and affect the structure and functions of the brain. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) allows to evaluate the synaptic plasticity responses of the motor cortex to exercise, while cognitive function responses are evaluated via cognitive tests. Additionally, exercise type and intensity influence the responses of cortical excitability and cognitive function. This research proposal aims to investigate how acute high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIT) changes primary motor cortex (M1) excitability, M1-related cognitive functions, and peripheral BDNF and Cathepsin B levels in healthy sedentary adults and to investigate the relationship between these neurophysiological parameters. All parameters will be measured before and after the acute exercise. M1 excitability will be evaluated through resting motor threshold, short interval intracortical inhibition, and input-output curve measurements. Cognitive functions will be evaluated through mental rotation and working memory tasks, and peripheral signal responses will be measured by serum levels of BDNF and Cathepsin B. Our hypotheses are: 1) Acute HIIT will increase peripheral BDNF and CTSB level, cortical excitability, and M1-specific cognitive function performance. 2) M1 excitability, cognitive function performance, and peripheral BDNF and CTSB increase will be related following exercise. Our findings will have the potential to be a guide for the integration of exercise into daily life and will provide cortical and peripheral data on the neurophysiological basis of the relationship between exercise and cognition.",
    "detailedSummary": "Participants Twenty-eight healthy young adults (female|male:14|14) aged 20-30 years will have\r\n      participated in the study.\r\n\r\n      Participants will be at least undergraduate students, right-handed dominant, exercising <150\r\n      minutes per week in the last six months. Before the experiment, the participants will be\r\n      evaluated for their background, family history, and whether they have any health complaints\r\n      that prevent them from exercising.\r\n\r\n      With the adult transcranial magnetic stimulation safety screening questionnaire, participants\r\n      in the risk group for brain stimulation, those with intracranial implants and\r\n      contraindications, and those with a history of any psychiatric or neurological disease,\r\n      seizures, any serious medical condition, or pregnancy will be excluded. The hand preference\r\n      questionnaire will evaluate hand preference, and physical activity status will be evaluated\r\n      by the short version of the international physical activity questionnaire. The\r\n      cardiorespiratory fitness will be assessed with the graded maximal exercise stress test. The\r\n      N-back test is a continuous performance test used to assess working memory capacity. The\r\n      mental rotation test will evaluate the mental rotation score. The research team designed both\r\n      tests.\r\n\r\n      Transcranial magnetic stimulation will be used to assess corticomotor excitability. Resting\r\n      Motor Threshold (RMT), Short Interval Intracortical Inhibition (SICI), and input-output curve\r\n      measurements will be performed on all participants in our study for the TMS study.\r\n\r\n      BDNF and CTSB measurements of the participants will be made both at baseline and following\r\n      the acute exercise.\r\n\r\n      HIIT exercise lasting 23 minutes will be performed on the bicycle ergometer. Participants\r\n      will make 3 visits to the laboratory. First session: Cardiorespiratory fitness assessment,\r\n      all questionnaires. Second session: TMS analyses, cognitive assessments, HIIT, myokine\r\n      assessments Third session: TMS analyses, cognitive assessments, control (watching a nature\r\n      documentary).\r\n\r\n      The second and third sessions will be performed by cross-over design. Data analysis will be\r\n      performed with two-way repeated ANOVA to determine the effect of within-group factors\r\n      (control and HIIT) and time (PRE and POST) on corticospinal excitability and other\r\n      parameters. When the effect size was calculated as \u0273p2 >0.26, the sample size was calculated\r\n      a priori as n = 22. Considering possible data losses, the number of participants was\r\n      determined as 28.",

    "detailedSummary": "Overweight and obesity are public health issues of epidemic proportions nowadays. They\r\n      constitute risk factors for several chronic diseases with vascular, metabolic, and\r\n      inflammatory changes. Adequate serum levels of vitamin D are correlated with good\r\n      cardiovascular and metabolic health, since its deficiency and insufficiency (highly prevalent\r\n      in obesity) have an inverse correlation. Likewise, vitamin K, especially K2, is related to\r\n      the reduction of arterial stiffness, suppression of the inflammation in the vascular wall,\r\n      favorable action on the lipid profile, whereas insufficiency is related to increased\r\n      cardiovascular risk. The combined use of vitamin D and K aiming to reduce cardiovascular risk\r\n      has been studied, however, the results of randomized clinical trials are still controversial.\r\n      This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial aims to evaluate the\r\n      effect of supplementation of vitamins D3 and K2-MK7 on vascular function, sympathetic tone,\r\n      metabolic biomarkers and inflammatory factors in a population of overweight or obese adults\r\n      and serum levels of deficient or insufficient vitamin D. Individuals of both sexes, aged\r\n      between 40 and 70 years, body mass index (BMI) \u2265 25 and < 40 kg/m\u00b2 and vitamin 25OHD3 <30\r\n      ng/ml will be randomized into 3 groups (A/B/C) to receive supplementation (Placebo/VitD3 7000\r\n      IU/VitD3 7000IU+K2-MK7-180mcg) daily for 16 weeks. Individuals will be rated at 4 visits\r\n      namely:\r\n\r\n        -  V0 screening according to inclusion and exclusion criteria; clinical, anthropometry and\r\n           electrical bioimpedance, laboratory and vascular evaluation before supplementation;\r\n\r\n        -  V1 supplementation begins;\r\n\r\n        -  V2 after 8 weeks;\r\n\r\n        -  V3 at the end of the intervention. The laboratory evaluation consists of blood count,\r\n           biochemistry, electrolytes, glucose, lipid, liver and thyroid profiles, vitamin D3 and\r\n           parathyroid hormone, in addition to the urinary excretion of calcium and creatinine.\r\n           Sympathetic tone is assessed by a frequency meter (Polar\u00ae Verity Sense), arterial\r\n           stiffness by measuring the pulse wave velocity by oscillometry (Mobil-O-Graph\u00ae) and\r\n           endothelium function by measuring post-occlusion microvascular reactivity using laser\r\n           speckle contrast image-LSCI.",

Follow-up measures at 20 minutes post-intervention will be\r\n      performed.\r\n\r\n      Intervention for the Thrust-mobilization Group The intervention group will receive passive\r\n      spinal rotational grade V mobilization, based on Maitland's approach. The intervention will\r\n      be performed with the subject in right sidelying and left sidelying. The operator's palpating\r\n      hand is placed over the L2-3 intervertebral space, and the other hand bends both legs of the\r\n      participant up to the range at which the L2-3 midposition is found. The participant is then\r\n      asked to straighten the lower leg and hook the upper leg over it with the upper leg's knee\r\n      positioned over the side of the plinth. While the lower component is kept still, the\r\n      participant's trunk is rotated until the hip starts to lift off from the plinth. The bottom\r\n      hand and uppermost hand rest under a pillow and the chest wall, respectively. With the\r\n      starting position settled, the operator stands behind the participant, takes up the slack\r\n      within the spine and then provides a grade V mobilization while stabilizing the uppermost\r\n      shoulder.\r\n\r\n      Intervention for the Sham Group Subjects are positioned in right sidelying. The experimenter\r\n      holds both knees with one arm while placing their opposite hand on the participant's lumbar\r\n      spine. The experimenter performs 1 min of \ufb02exion and extension PROM without reaching\r\n      physiological end range in either direction of movement. This is repeated with the subject in\r\n      left sidelying.\r\n\r\n      Double Blind: The subjects will not know what intervention they are receiving - same generic\r\n      script is provided. One Investigator is performing all pre and post-tests without knowledge\r\n      of intervention, the other investigator is opening the envelope and providing the\r\n      intervention behind a screen without knowledge of test results.

The objective of the proposed research is to optimize EFP by identifying engagement-focused intervention elements to add to EFP that enhance its effects on parenting skills.",
    "detailedSummary": "The study is a longitudinal factorial optimization trial in a community sample of 800 parents\r\n      with 1.5- to 3-year-old children. There are 4 experimental factors; each corresponds to the\r\n      presence vs. absence of an engagement-focused intervention element. This experiment enables\r\n      the estimation of the individual and combined effects of each element. The specific aims\r\n      follow.\r\n\r\n      Aim 1: Optimize the effects of EFP on parenting skills by determining which combination of\r\n      the four experimental engagement-focused intervention elements results in the greatest\r\n      success of EFP, as reflected in increasing parent warmth and reducing corporal punishment,\r\n      overreactive and lax discipline.\r\n\r\n      Aim 2: Determine the extent to which boosted meaningful parent engagement in EFP is the\r\n      mechanism driving the effects of the four engagement-focused intervention elements on\r\n      parenting skills, and which aspect(s) of engagement (e.g., content consumption; behavioral\r\n      skills practice) are the key mediators that translate the effects of the four\r\n      engagement-focused intervention elements into improved parenting.\r\n\r\n      Aim 3: Examine parent (e.g., change readiness; race) and child characteristics (e.g.,\r\n      externalizing behavior; sex) to determine if the optimal intervention package differs among\r\n      subgroups. Cracking the code of providing parents with an intervention that they actually\r\n      use, and that improves parenting, could have far-reaching effects (e.g., improving\r\n      population-level child outcomes).",

    "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of meat on inflammatory and metabolite profiles in middle-aged individuals after an acute meal. Up to 40 adults, who are overweight or obese and between 30-60 years old will undergo a consent/screening visit, followed by three study visits. On separate visits to the clinical research facilities at the Center for Human Nutrition Studies, participants will consume either 9 oz (250 grams) of cooked grain-fed beef, grass-fed beef, or a plant-based meat alternative (Impossible Burger). Blood will be drawn prior to food consumption and three more times after eating the meal at 1h, 3h, and 5h after participants finishing their meal. The investigators will use those blood samples to determine the impacts of these foods on inflammatory markers and metabolite profiles (compounds that circulate in our blood such as amino acids, fatty acids, and phenolics).",
    "detailedSummary": "BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n      An increasing number of people is interested in consuming either grass-fed beef or\r\n      plant-based beef alternatives, such as the Impossible BurgerTM or Beyond MeatTM, believing\r\n      that these choices are beneficial for consumer health; however, little to no work has been\r\n      performed to study these beliefs and claims. The purpose of this study is to evaluate effects\r\n      of plant-based meat, grass-fed beef, and grain-fed beef on postprandial plasma inflammatory\r\n      and metabolite profiles in middle aged adults (30-60 y old). This work will offer new insight\r\n      into manipulating the acute, post-meal inflammatory state by consumer food choices. It will\r\n      also provide more insight how food-derived metabolites impact systemic metabolites in the\r\n      human body through metabolomics analysis. This study will utilize a randomized cross-over\r\n      design and every participant will consume each type of meat on three separate occasions\r\n      separated by a minimum of three days.\r\n\r\n      STUDY OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\n        -  To determine the effects of consuming 9 oz of the Impossible BurgerTM, grass-fed beef,\r\n           or grain-fed beef on 300 min postprandial plasma inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1,\r\n           C-reactive protein, and VCAM-1).\r\n\r\n        -  To determine effects on plasma metabolites (vitamin and mineral derivatives,\r\n           polyphenols, amino acids etc.) collected through regular blood sampling during the 300\r\n           min postprandial phase (at 60 min, 180 min, and 300 min).\r\n\r\n        -  To determine the effects on subjective satiety at 15, 30, 60 min and every hour\r\n           thereafter following consumption.\r\n\r\n      DESIGN AND PROCEDURES\r\n\r\n      Participants will be asked to complete one screening/consent visit and three testing visits\r\n      throughout their participation in the study. All visits will take place in clinical research\r\n      space located at the Center for Human Nutrition Studies (CHNS) at Utah State University.\r\n\r\n      Phone Screen (Week 1. Duration: 15 min): Interested participants will be pre-screened by\r\n      telephone, using a scripted list of questions (see attached) to identify individuals that may\r\n      be eligible for study entry. Suitable candidates will then be provided a REDCap survey link\r\n      to complete additional screening questions that asks them further details about their health,\r\n      dietary habits, and sleep habits (see inclusion/exclusion criteria). Only the minimum PHI\r\n      will be collected to determine eligibility. Responses will be reviewed by a study team member\r\n      (all study team members will have completed the necessary CITI training) and potentially\r\n      eligible candidates will be contacted to schedule a consent/screening visit. The pre-screen\r\n      is put in place to confirm that the participant meets most of the inclusion/exclusion\r\n      criteria before the subject is scheduled for a consent meeting. The phone screen is thus\r\n      performed to limit the amount of ineligible research participants that are consented/screened\r\n      that could easily be excluded by means of a phone screening. This would also provide\r\n      interested participants with the opportunity to ask additional questions about the study and\r\n      to determine if they are interested in moving forward with a consent/screening visit. This\r\n      will limit both subject and research staff time burden.\r\n\r\n      Consent Visit (Week 1. Duration: 1 hour): This visit can be done virtually through Zoom or\r\n      occur in person in the Center for Human Nutrition Studies (CHNS) at Utah State University.\r\n      Potential subjects will attend a consent session conducted by a trained member of the\r\n      research staff to present the details of the study. Interested participants will complete the\r\n      informed consent process privately with study staff. The investigators will allow up to 60\r\n      minutes for the subjects to read the consent and ask questions. If a subject wants additional\r\n      time to think about the study, this will be allowed. The study team will contact the subject\r\n      three days after the initial consent visit ask if he or she has come to a decision. No study\r\n      procedures will take place before written consent is obtained. To minimize subject burden,\r\n      participants will be instructed during the phone screen that they have to opportunity to\r\n      combine the consent visit with their screening visit (see below). If participants wish to\r\n      combine visits, they are instructed that they will have to perform this visit in the morning\r\n      after an overnight, 12-hour fast.\r\n\r\n      Screening Visit (Week 1. Duration: 1 hour): This visit will take place at the Center for\r\n      Human Nutrition Studies (CHNS) and will last approximately 1 hour. The investigators ask\r\n      participants to come in during the morning after an overnight, 12-hour fast. During this\r\n      visit the following procedures will be performed:\r\n\r\n        -  Blood Draw: A trained phlebotomist (the PI) will draw a fasted blood sample for routine\r\n           blood work (see table 2 below) to ensure the participant qualifies for the study. Using\r\n           a small needle, 12 ml blood will be collected from a vein in the participant's forearm\r\n           or hand. Blood samples will be sent to LabCorp to be analyzed for HbA1C, Glucose, Basic\r\n           Metabolic Panel (BMP), and Lipid panel. The blood of women of childbearing potential\r\n           will be subject to a pregnancy test (hCG) as part of this screening blood draw. This\r\n           will also occur through LabCorp.\r\n\r\n        -  Body mass and height. Height (cm) will be measured without shoes. Body mass (kg) will be\r\n           measured without shoes, coats, or sweaters. BMI will be calculated as body mass (kg) /\r\n           height (m)2.\r\n\r\n        -  Blood pressure: A blood pressure measurement will be taken using an automated upper arm\r\n           blood pressure monitor (Omron BP5250). A total of three measurements will be taken and\r\n           the average value of those will be collected for participant characterization.\r\n\r\n        -  Questionnaires: Participant will be given a three-day food and sleep log to fill out for\r\n           three days prior to each of the metabolic visits described below. The participant will\r\n           also be given a food frequency questionnaire once at the beginning of the study, which\r\n           will ask them about how often they consume animal products and if they are any of the\r\n           following: \"grass-fed, organic, pasture-raised, or bought on a farmers market\". This\r\n           will give us an indication of the habitual consumption of pasture-raised animal products\r\n           of the participants. The food frequency questionnaire that will be used is a modified\r\n           version of the Diet History Questionnaire III (NIH) with a 5-point ordinal scale as\r\n           adapted from Baudry et al. (2015) (see attachment). The questionnaire reviews food and\r\n           beverages typically consumed over the past year and takes approximately 30 minutes to\r\n           complete.\r\n\r\n      Metabolic visits (Weeks 2-4. Number of Visits: 3. Duration: 7 hours each): These three visits\r\n      will take approximately 7-hours each and will take place at The Center for Human Nutrition\r\n      Studies (CHNS). Visits will be at least 3 days apart. Participants are required to fast for\r\n      12 hours prior to reporting to the laboratory. During this, participants will complete the\r\n      following:\r\n\r\n        -  Meat consumption: Using a randomized cross-over design, participants will ingest 250 g\r\n           (9 oz) of an Impossible BurgerTM burger (plant), a grain-fed beef burger (grain-fed), a\r\n           grass-fed beef burger (grass-fed). The meat will be stored as 9 oz. (250 g) patties in\r\n           designated food freezers (-40 \u00b0C) in the NDFS kitchen and thawed overnight in a\r\n           refrigerator (4 \u00b0C) prior to the subject's arrival the next morning. The meat will be\r\n           cooked on a griddle in the CHNS metabolic kitchen on each side until an instant-read\r\n           meat thermometer registers an internal temperature of 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C). The patties will\r\n           then be immediately served to the participant. Participants are provided with a\r\n           standardized amount of water (1.5 liters) to drink during the 300 min post-meal phase.\r\n           Participants will be asked to eat and drink the water at a comfortable rate but to try\r\n           and finish within 30 min. No other food is allowed to be consumed during the ensuing 300\r\n           min postprandial phase. No other liquids are allowed to be consumed during that time as\r\n           this would interfere with our protocol (see urine collection below). Subjects are also\r\n           expected to remain seated in a chair during this time and can work/read/or watch\r\n           entertainment on their own electronic device. Participants will be allowed to get up and\r\n           use the rest-room; however, the investigators will ask participants to remain sedentary\r\n           otherwise.\r\n\r\n        -  Blood Draws: An intravenous catheter (IV) will be temporarily placed into a forearm or\r\n           hand vein by a trained member of the study team (the PI) to collect repeated blood\r\n           samples. The catheter will remain viable by a slow drip of saline. The investigators\r\n           will collect four samples total (10 mL each; 40 mL or 2 \u00bd tablespoons) on each of the\r\n           three metabolic visits. One sample will be collected right before participants eat and\r\n           three more samples will be collected at 60, 180 min and 300 min after they consume the\r\n           meal. These draws will be taken in a private room in clinical facilities, in a reclining\r\n           leather chair. Participants will be provided with their clinical lab results that will\r\n           be obtained from LabCorp. Results from bloodwork will be shared with participants via\r\n           encrypted email using a USU email account.\r\n\r\n        -  Urine Collection: A baseline urine sample will be collected prior to food consumption.\r\n           Participants are asked to completely empty their bladder prior to food consumption.\r\n           After food consumption, all urine will be collected in a urine jug (a 3000 mL urine\r\n           collection bottle) during the 300-minute postprandial phase to study metabolites in the\r\n           urine. All urine collections will be done by the participant themselves in private\r\n           restroom facilities.\r\n\r\n        -  Satiety Scale: Participants are asked to mark a validated satiety scale at 30, 60, 90,\r\n           120 min, and every hour thereafter until 300 min to assess subjective satiety after meat\r\n           consumption.\r\n\r\n      Dietary and activity control: The investigators will ask participants to maintain their\r\n      habitual diet, physical activity, and sleep levels.TThe investigators will ask participants\r\n      to fill in 3-day dietary and sleep logs for the three days prior to their metabolic visit\r\n      (see attachments). The investigators will also ask them to refrain from alcohol and strenuous\r\n      physical activity (running, weightlifting etc.) for 2 days prior to each metabolic visit. The\r\n      dietary and sleep logs will give the investigators insight if lifestyle factors leading up to\r\n      each visit were similar and are likely to promote compliance to ensure robust biomarker\r\n      results (inflammatory cytokines and metabolomics). Participants are asked to replicate their\r\n      3-day foods logs and sleep schedule as much as possible prior to each visit. Participants are\r\n      also asked to not consume red meat or soy (main ingredient of plant burger) the day before\r\n      each visit. This is done to minimize any prior presence of common red meat and soy-derived\r\n      metabolites in the urine.",

    "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to assess patient persistence and adherence with a 6-month period of at-home visual field testing, using a novel web-based visual field test (EyeSimplify, M&S Technologies, Niles, IL). The main questions this clinical trials aims to answer are: 1. How adherent patients are to biweekly testing at home for 6 months, and 2. How patients feel the ease of user experience of the test was, and 3. Whether the EyeSimplify platform is able to detect any worsening of glaucoma-related visual field performance that can be corroborated by standard of care, office-based testing. Participants will be given iPads with links to the EyeSimplify visual field test, and asked to take the EyeSimplify tests at home biweekly for six months. The test takes between 10 to 15 minutes to do and participants will have no additional responsibilities between tests. Researchers will send reminders for patients to complete the at-home tests at periodic intervals, and if worsening on the at-home test platform is suggested by test results, researchers will arrange for return visits to the office to compare the EyeSimplify test results to standard-of-care, office-based testing. At the conclusion of the study, participant adherence to the 6-month biweekly testing schedule will be assessed and participants will be surveyed for their perceptions regarding the EyeSimplify platform's ease of usability and user experience.",
    "detailedSummary": "The purpose of this prospective study is to assess patient persistence and adherence with a\r\n      6-month period of at-home visual field testing using an iPad with a novel web-browser-based\r\n      visual field test, the EyeSimplify platform (M&S Technologies, Niles, IL). Use of this test\r\n      is intended to supplement, but not replace, regular clinic visits.\r\n\r\n      The proposed study will be conducted at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. We\r\n      estimate 50 subjects will be recruited to participate in the study. Data collected will not\r\n      include patient identifiers, but will instead be coded.\r\n\r\n      The research will involve prospective collection of visual field tests. Patients with\r\n      suspected, mild, moderate, or severe glaucoma will be included. Clinical data including age,\r\n      gender, ethnicity, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, severity of disease, past and\r\n      comparative Humphrey HFA-III visual field test performance, EyeSimplify visual field test\r\n      performance, and EyeSimplify usability survey will be recorded.\r\n\r\n      Following study recruitment, subjects will be asked to take EyeSimplify visual field tests at\r\n      home biweekly for six months. They will have no additional responsibilities between tests.\r\n      Subjects will access the EyeSimplify web browser on an iPad provided by the research team,\r\n      using a link and login credentials provided to them by a research assistant. Upon logging\r\n      into the EyeSimplify web browser, subjects will click the \"Start Test\" button found along the\r\n      left side of the window and follow the prompts presented on screen to calibrate their screen.\r\n      Screen calibration involves holding a driver's license/credit card/ID to the screen to ensure\r\n      the test window is the appropriate dimensions. Following screen calibration, subjects will\r\n      follow the test prompts presented on screen to complete their visual field test. Test results\r\n      are automatically sent to the research assistant who issued the exam, so subjects may exit\r\n      the browser after each test. Upon study completion, subjects will be asked to fill out a\r\n      brief user experience survey.\r\n\r\n      M&S Technologies is the developer of the EyeSimplify visual field test platform. As the\r\n      developers, M&S Technologies maintains a secure, encrypted, HIPAA-compliant database of test\r\n      participants. This database includes patient profiles containing unique subject IDs\r\n      (de-identified), birth year (but not specific date), and visual field testing results.\r\n      Outside of this testing information, M&S Technologies does not have access to any additional\r\n      patient information.",

    "briefSummary": "Two-arm parallel-randomized pilot study and to collect data at the Department of Geriatric Medicine at Aalborg University Hospital. The aim is to assess the feasibility of a future randomized controlled study comparing Danish versions of 3D-CAM and 4AT in an acute medical setting. The primary objective is to assess 1) feasibility of obtaining informed consent and recruiting older adults within 24 hours of admission (or surgery) at the Department of Geriatric Medicine, Department of Acute Medicine, or Department of Orthopedic Surgery. Secondary objectives are 2a) to compare feasibility of recruitment and testing in the three different departments, 2b) to inform a preliminary evaluation of validity and reliability of the Danish version of screening instruments, and 2c) to obtain data on variance to support calculating sample size for a full-scale RCT.",
    "detailedSummary": "We will recruit participants through a consecutive sampling of all potentially eligible\r\n      patients. Recruitment will take place in three different settings: the Department of\r\n      Geriatric Medicine, the Department of Acute Medicine, and the Department of Orthopedic\r\n      Surgery. One week will be allocated for recruitment in each setting.\r\n\r\n      Potentially delirious patients often have impaired cognitive status. Therefore, the process\r\n      of recruitment and informed consent is critically important and poses a central issue of\r\n      feasibility to be assessed in this study.\r\n\r\n      It cannot be known with certainty whether patients are delirious prior to inclusion into the\r\n      study, and even among delirious patients, there are considerable circadian fluctuations (as\r\n      this is a hallmark of the condition), meaning that patients may have lucid moments during the\r\n      day where they are cognitively intact and may be able to give informed consent.\r\n\r\n      Generally, informed consent will be sought from participants when possible. In case they are\r\n      permanently or temporarily unable to give informed consent, informed consent will be sought\r\n      from next of kin. Due to the short time in the study for each participant, it is not\r\n      anticipated that participants will regain the ability to give informed consent during the\r\n      study. However, if they do, new informed consent will be obtained from the participant. The\r\n      number of potential participants at each step will be documented to assess problems with\r\n      feasibility.",

    "briefSummary": "FLAME is an open-label cluster-randomized controlled trial that aims to determine the effectiveness of focal mass drug administration (fMDA) to reduce the incidence of Plasmodium vivax malaria in the Loreto Department in Peru. Standard interventions, including symptomatic and asymptomatic screening for malaria infections, provision of insecticide-treated bednets, and environmental transmission monitoring, will be compared to clusters of villages randomized to receive anti-malarial drugs.",
    "detailedSummary": "In several countries where malaria is nearing elimination, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and\r\n      Plasmodium vivax (Pv) are co-endemic. Plasmodium vivax infections pose unique challenges for\r\n      malaria elimination, including that Pv cases are more easily missed through standard\r\n      diagnostics and that Pv has the ability to remain latent in liver-stage (hypnozoites), which\r\n      can cause relapses for weeks to years.\r\n\r\n      Active case detection (ACD) is an effective tool used by many malaria elimination programs,\r\n      however, asymptomatic infections can still be missed due to limited sensitivity of ACD\r\n      diagnostic tools. Mass drug administration (MDA) has been recommended for Pf elimination as\r\n      an alternative approach to ACD in regions where there is sufficient access to treatment.\r\n      Recommendations for use of MDA do not yet extend to Pv as a result of limited evidence and\r\n      difficulty in administering existing anti-malarial drugs daily for one to two weeks.\r\n\r\n      This study aims to assess the effectiveness of MDA in the Loreto Department in Peru by\r\n      implementing a more targeted approach: focal MDA. This approach targets drug administration\r\n      to households at the highest risk of infection to minimize the potential adverse effects of\r\n      MDA and promote uptake. Further, preliminary data from the study site region suggests that\r\n      recurrences of malaria infections in index cases and clustering of infections around these\r\n      index cases drive continued transmission of Pv. Thus, fMDA is an appropriate approach to\r\n      study in this region.\r\n\r\n      The primary research objectives are:\r\n\r\n        1. To determine the effectiveness of three rounds of fMDA to reduce Pv transmission in the\r\n           Loreto Department, Peru compared to standard interventions.\r\n\r\n        2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of fMDA by measuring incidence of severe adverse\r\n           events or severe malaria in the treatment arm.\r\n\r\n        3. To measure the cost-effectiveness and acceptability of fMDA by calculating the cost per\r\n           malaria case averted for intervention and control arms.",

    "detailedSummary": "Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) remains a common surgical technique for the\r\n      management of lumbar spondylosis requiring decompression and fusion. The choice of interbody\r\n      spacer remains dependent on surgeon preference with a variety of options available for use.\r\n      Two of the most commonly used interbody spacers are made of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and\r\n      titanium.1 While both spacers have produced reliable rates of fusion with good clinical\r\n      outcomes, debate remains as to which interbody spacer is superior. Proponents of PEEK argue\r\n      that it is radiolucent and has an elastic modulus similar to bone thus decreasing rates of\r\n      subsidence. However, PEEK is a hydrophobic material that does not integrate with bone.\r\n      Titanium on the other hand demonstrates osseointegration and may lead to increased rates of\r\n      fusion.While there are retrospective studies available comparing the two materials, the\r\n      studies are small and there is a paucity of prospective data comparing the radiographic and\r\n      clinical outcomes of these spacers. Given the frequency with which these spacers are used, it\r\n      is important to determine which spacer produces better clinical and radiographic outcomes for\r\n      patients.",
